[{I was watching someone use a piece of software that reconstructed timelines... it looked like video editing. It was showing thousands of clips that were being manipulated all at once in some kind of semi-automated way.}]
[me: "What is this program called?"]
[{I was shown a very dull-looking brown box that looked like the kinds of packages productivity software came in during the 80s. The title of the program was "Ionic Multiplier".}]
[note {That isn't a popular phrase on the internet, but has two mentions in the context of chemistry and physics.}]
[{Later a man was showing me some technical specs and had <i>Clear Gigabit Ram</i>.}]
[me: "What does clear mean in this context?"]
[him: ("shocked?") "How could *you* not know?"]
[me: {I'm sorry, I don't. Is it optically transparent, like can you see through it?}]
[him: {No. It specifically relates to the way memory access is performed.}]
[{Beyond that, I couldn't get it explained in a way that I could understand.}]
