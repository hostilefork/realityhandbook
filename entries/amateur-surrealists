[{Looking in a bathroom mirror, I noticed the image was not right at all, so I must be dreaming. When I came out of the bathroom I was in an apartment with lots of people.}]
[{A guy who introduced himself as Otto grabbed me and pinned me to the ground. He started tickling me around the middle section and I thought it was going to be the end and I'd wake up. But I asked pleadingly what he was doing, why it tickled, and why it woke me up. At first he gave some answers like he thought he had told an amusing double-entendre.}]
[otto: {It wakes you up because it is in the middle. And isn't it good to get the half?}]
[me: "What is that supposed to mean?"]
[otto: {The only reason this attack can wake you up is because you haven't had practice toughening up. I'm helping to train you and will stop when it goes too far.}]
[{Another guy was watching and suggested what the signals should be for Otto to do various awakening-stopping-operations. Once that was finished, I asked about whether they had any drugs or substances which would extend my time there.}]
[man: "Yes, you need a hallucinogenic."]
[{I was poured a yellow liquid into a small cup, but before I drank it someone said that I needed to mix it with another substance. When they mixed it, the result turned into a solid ice. I chomped down the ice and made a bit of a mess, but felt okay.}]
[{So I began asking many questions and griping in general about my situation. I sensed I was in someone's home and they were being nice and tolerating me, so I tried not to ruffle through too many of the drawers. I just picked up objects I saw sitting around that I might be able to ask about or study. One was an "ambient music visualizer"...device that you plugged into a stereo and would generate light patterns...I'd expected it to be fancier, but it wasn't. There were some good speeches people gave me.}]
[man: {Your scientific establishment consists basically of amateur surrealists. They spend all their time trying to explain how all of conscious life emerged from a pool of water molecules with no outside intervention.}]
[{While inquiring about how I could bridge communications with the waking world, one guy began a rant.}]
[guy: {We have a risky enough job already. And it's getting to be even harder now. We've lost touch with my colony in particular because of the propagation of <i>that drug</i>.}]
[note {I didn't know what drug he meant. A drug that blocks you for your whole life...Flouride? A drug applied to cut lines of communication when they start, a la <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=sUUHNf0S5cA">Lithium</a>? More likely if it's something that has separated the people of Earth from other dimensions from the beginning it would be something we hadn't heard about.}]
