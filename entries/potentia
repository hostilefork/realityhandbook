[{A man approached me in a dream, he was wearing a jacket and seemed friendly, I went to shake his hand and started to speak but he started to speak at the same time. We were a bit surprised by that and stepped back from each other.}]
[him: "You go first."]
[me: {I was going to comment that you seemed to have...good energy. I worry a lot about getting attacked when I start speaking to people in dreams.}]
[me: {I'm glad to meet someone else who's had the same neck operation I had.}]
[note {I've never had a neck operation, to the best of my knowledge.}]
[{He shook my hand and I noticed another hand coming out of the same sleeve. I worried that as I was shaking his hand that one was going to come up and attack me, but it didn't. We walked toward an open door so he could show me something outside.}]
[him: {I'd like to teach you the concept of <i>Oneironaut time</i>}]
[me: {Thanks, but I'm afraid I probably don't have a whole lot of time left before I wake up. Are you alive on earth at this time? Can you give me a clearly identifying name, something I can search for?}]
[him: {Yes... I'm on Earth, and I'm 30 years old. Let me give you this...}]
[{He handed me a portfolio. It was hard for me to read the flyers and business cards in it.}]
[me: {I don't think this is going to work. How about a website, a URL, something? Help me out because I can't really get a fix on this.}]
[him: "Potensha!"]
[me: "Ummm, potensha what?"]
[him: {You know, like...<i>potential</i>...the potential energy between people, that sort of thing. I'm on the forum.}]
[note {looking up potentia it seems to be a term that shows up in some metaphysical talk. I don't see anything particularly interesting pointing at a particular person.}]
[{I tried telling him what my alias was and spelling it out. He handed me back a business card that had someone else's name on it but my alias. I told him that wasn't me, and wrote my name on the card...then immediately woke up.}]
