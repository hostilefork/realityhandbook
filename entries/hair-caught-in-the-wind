[{I was tinkering with a mess of stereo equipment after noticing it was playing on the main speakers even though I had headphones plugged into it. I was concerned that I had been disturbing my neighbors.}]
[{During my inspection of the elaborate controls while I tried to figure out their purpose, I noticed an old lady walk up and sit in my desk chair. She was diffuse enough that it clued me into the fact that I was dreaming.}]
[me: "Hey old lady! Who are you? Where are you from?"]
[old-lady: "Oh, I'm from far away."]
[me: {Okay, uh...if you had to guess where I was from, then where would you say? What AM I?}]
[{She didn't have an answer, and she generally seemed to be fumbling for words.}]
[me: {Well, can you tell me *something* of interest? Do you consider yourself alive? Dead? What? I mean, I'm just not used to seeing...}]
[old-lady: ("interrupting") {Not used to seeing people show up in your bedroom? Yes you are.}]
[{Her face started quivering and getting closer and farther away.}]
[me: "You're moving around too much. Stop doing that."]
[old-lady: {I'm sorry but bobbing around is just a habit, it's a tick I can't do anything about.}]
[{To keep "in sync" I would remind her not to veer too far off, or she would kick me and I would then touch the foot to say "still here".}]
[me: {Well I haven't *always* been used to phantom people showing up in my room. How do I reconcile this with the materialist interpretations of people around me?}]
[old-lady: {Why worry about it? What makes those people important? Rebuild new ones from scratch!}]
[me: "I'm unable to do that."]
[{She was wavering, and I followed her onto a couch that was rapidly raising off the ground into some kind of ledge. As I did, she was getting younger and we caught a reflection in the mirror. There was another girl behind us at a table.}]
[girl: ("resignedly") {Oh no, you're quite good at it. Especially with that kind of girl.}]
[me: "What do you mean by 'that kind'?"]
[girl: "It's all about the hair caught in the wind..."]
