[{I was working on a laptop and was pretty sure I was dreaming, because this often happens... where I'm using a computer that has a lot more programs installed on it than mine. It was running OS/X and had some kind of hardware/driver utility open... so you could see all the things installed on the machine.}]
[{Firing up a web browser, I tried to Google for my name, but someone else was typing at me--using the URL bar as a place to have a conversation. They indicated that they knew I was trying to search for myself, and began to type as I watched.}]
[typed: {Your problems with madness started in June 2001, when Federal investigators knocked on your door and took you to meet Jamie Zawinski}]
[note {Jamie Zawinkski is the infamous <lj user="jwz">, who is a programmer who worked on the Mozilla project, who is also a somewhat prolific blogger. I do not know him personally, but stylistically I'd say we have a lot in common... especially, well, the prolific part. From surface metrics I'd say he seems like a reasonable, curious, and intelligent fellow.}]
[{After this, the writing started to turn red. A hand moved in to block the red writing so I could not read it. Angrily I tried to bite or move the hand, but this was ineffective, and I couldn't read the rest of the story.}]
[note {Since this is the second time some relationship between me and Mozilla has been mentioned, I added a tag for it. Outside of using Firefox, I've not been involved in the project in any way.}]
