[{I began fighting something that was attacking me. It was a battle I ended up winning. Next I knew I was walking around in an outdoor mall that seemed to have a lot of fraternity-looking people around, but some of them were people I sort of recognized. I gathered them together in a group and addressed them:}]
[me: {This is an important question, I need you to pay attention. The 'I' speaking to you right now has no concept of the place we are right now, prior to now. I just materialized. From your perception, was I here before? Like, last week... did you know someone like myself speaking to you now?}]
[them: "We don't know. We weren't here last week."]
[me: {Well then, where were you before you showed up here?}]
[them: "Burning Man."]
["And I awoke."]
