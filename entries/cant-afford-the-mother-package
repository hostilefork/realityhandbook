[{Realizing I was dreaming, I went to hop out of bed and climb down some stairs. The girl in bed with me looked upset.}]
[me: "You can come with me if you want."]
[girl: "Yay!"]
[{Descending the stairs, I walked into the kitchen, and there were several people gathered there. It reminded me of a kitchen from a house I used to live in. For some reason they were familiar people, though I don't believe I've met them before. We went through introductions, and a girl told me her name was "Brie".}]
[me: {Well what are you guys doing here, in this kitchen?}]
[guy-one: {It's comfortable, I guess. Like...this cutting board, it reminds me of mom's kitchen.}]
[guy-two: "And I guess it's out of fear, too."]
[{Some scary/eerie music started playing. I perceived it was coming from under the table on a stereo or something.}]
[me: "Hey. Hey. Stop that music. Fear of *what*?"]
[guy-two: {It's like you said when the company went down...there's just a lot of uncertainty right now. Out there.}]
[me: "Well that still doesn't explain why you're here."]
[guy-one: "We couldn't afford the mother package."]
[me: "What do you mean? I didn't buy any of this."]
[brie: {Oh, so these are actual memories then. Hm. And I suppose she's from your love life... beautiful.}]
[{She said it with some sarcasm, gesturing at the girl who had come down the stairs with me. Before I could interject with 'what do you mean by THAT' she spoke up for herself.}]
[girl: ("with a flat stare") "Yes. I am."]
[guy-one: {If you don't have any more questions, we'll be going now.}]
[me: "Wait. Well there's a question. Going where?"]
["He gestured out a window."]
[me: "How do you get out?"]
[guy-one: {You look for a crack, slip through. Or if all else fails, just skull the wall.}]
[me: "Skull?"]
[{He made a gesture like hitting his head on the wall, as if "skulling" something was to hit your head on it.}]
[me: {I'd suspect I'd wake up if I did that. Wait, do you ever 'wake up'? Is there another life from this one, some body you have somewhere.}]
[guy-one: ("shaking head, somewhat sadly") "No."]
