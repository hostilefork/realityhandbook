{LiveJournal entries were scrolling by at a mad pace, but somehow I was able to stop the entries and read them. When I realized I could read these journals from within the dream at a leisurely pace, I started looking at the user information for someone named "birdbird".}

[note {The birdbird LiveJournal apparently existed at one time, but has been "deleted and purged". There are some uses of the name birdbird on the web.}]

{Her full name was filled in as "Amy B. Straum". She had a collection of photos of herself, and she had long dark hair.}

[note {Mixed in with her own pictures was a photo of [Triumph the Insult Comic Dog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph%2C_the_Insult_Comic_Dog):} [picture %081204triumph.jpg] "...which caught my attention."]

{I thought it was going to be completely trivial to wake immediately up and type this in, but it took a solid couple of minutes for me to physically arise. I had a strange thought as I awoke which was "you're doing a good job, but don't store this in your teeth--store it in your BRAIN."}

[note {It made sense at the time, and if I had to spin that thought after the fact with an interpretation I would say that it was a calling to not make the tension of trying to remember something so great that I clench my teeth...because the resulting pain interferes with the ability to remember.}]
