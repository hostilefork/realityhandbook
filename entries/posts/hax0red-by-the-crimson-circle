    {I got on a bus of sorts, which was more like a pickup truck you just jumped into the back of. I realized it was carrying me further away from my destination, so I wanted to get off. It would back up in various spots, at seemingly handicapped-enabled water fountains... pause for a second... and then start up again. When I noticed this, I looked and saw that there was no driver.}

    {Hopping off at the next water fountain, I started walking back the way I came, through some kind of urban tunnel. When I did, I saw what looked like a plastic mat sliding along the ground, translucent with glowing yellow writing. I marveled at it, and a woman stopped to talk to me.}

]

dialog [

    woman: "It is used for police operations."

    me: "How does it work?"

    woman: "Get on."

]

print {I got on it, and she started making it move somehow. We went to some office, with many computers. I felt very lucid. She fired up something on a computer with a projector, and encouraged me to try it.}

dialog [woman: "Pick up that disc. Now throw it."]

print {What was on the screen was an augmented reality system. It realistically reflected my arm and let me interact with virtual objects on the screen.}

dialog [

    me: {Yes... lately, I've been talking to people about augmented reality. What is the name of your company?}

    woman: {We are *(company name)*. We did the very early demos...}

]

note {Cannot remember the company name, it was two words.}

dialog [

    me: "Do you mind if I, er, use your Google?"

    woman: "If you wish."

]

print {There were other people in the room. They watched me as I tried to look up my homepage. In the place of my homepage was something about being a friend of the "Crimson Circle".}

note [

    print {I know one person affiliated with this group. A non-"realityhandbook" address recently got an email from someone in that group on an unrelated topic, that said merely "Welcome [Shaumbra](http://www.manataka.org/page91.html)". Despite the brevity of that message, I replied with a link to this journal. Of Shaumbra, the page says:}

    quote {You're not going crazy, you're just Shaumbra moving into the new energy.}

    print "It says other things too."

]

dialog [me: {See, this Crimson Circle thing, I don't really know them. How are they taking over my homepage? I'm going to view source.}]

print {A small child came running up to me, and as I've had bad experiences with children in dreams I picked him up and threw him a little ways away. When he came again I threw him again, which seemed to discourage him from another attack.}

dialog [me: {I'm sorry, not trying to hurt that kid, he was just coming right for me.}]

print {The people were watching, and they started arguing amongst themselves.}

dialog [man-one: {You must balance therapeutic processes with guided disciplinary action when dealing with him.}]

note {I interpreted them to be looking at and discussing me in this context. Guess there's an off chance they might have meant the speedy child.}

dialog [

    me: {Yes! Yes. Er. More therapy, and more explanations, and less attacking! Can we do that? I mean, try EXPLAINING what I don't know to me and we'll make a lot more progress.}

    man-two: <exasperated> {But what if... what if you are *missing the code you need* to understand what you aren't getting?! What then?}
