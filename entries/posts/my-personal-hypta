{I was seated at a table with a large number of people. They were patting me on the back and telling me I'd made remarkable progress.}

[scottish-guy: "You are doing a lot better now. Very calm."]

[me: {Well, what I was doing before wasn't working. Something had to change.}]

{We talked for a while, and eventually lost contact. I wandered around the house I was in, into a living room. I pointed around.}

[me: {Where is this house? I mean...where would you say this house is?}]

[large-guy: "Hell."]

[me: "Hell?"]

[large-guy: ("laughing") {No, no. You'd know if you were in the Hell plane. It's got some seriously impressive architecture, I was thinking about bringing some of it here. Just this monstrous stuff...works of art.}]

{A guy holding a notepad who had glasses made a gesture at me to come look at something.}

[glasses-guy: {I've got something here. It's at least a month ahead of your current mathematics. If you could remember it, you'd blow people away.}]

[me: {That sounds excellent. Can it be written down simply?}]

[glasses-guy: {Unfortunately, no. I can split it in two parts though. One is a joke... a little rhyme to help you remember the coefficients. But you'd still have to remember this other formula.}]

{The formula he showed me was rather daunting, with about 20 symbols. The coefficients I needed to memorize were about 12 numbers.}

[me: {I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to do that. Is there anything simpler? I mean, an interesting invention? Something like a Rubik's Cube?}]

{People began to fumble around, and a guy pulled out a long roll of translucent plastic. It was divided into sections of various colors. He held it up to a light so I could see there were dotted out images on it.}

[plastic-guy: {What you do is you put this in front of a monitor, like a large screen TV on your ceiling. Then you have a machine slowly pull it past the screen. The effect is actually quite surprising once you see it in action.}]

[me: {Guess I'll have to take your word for it. What's it called?}]

[plastic-guy: "'My Personal Hypta'"]

{I tried to roll the plastic back into its original tube but it seemed to have become brittle and wouldn't fold. Gently I set it over in a corner in a pile, and went to address everyone.}

[me: "So... what are all of you? What am I?"]

[large-woman: {We're networks. Just like everything else. But I do enjoy the feeling of a human avatar, there's something visceral about it. I like men, but I like women too...}]

{The large woman was wearing very clothing which exposed a lot of her skin. I touched it to see what it felt like, but didn't feel like doing anything sexual.}

[me: {No offense to you all, but the avatars I perceive of you all here are rather...well, low end? If you had high technology and could pick any body you wanted, why these?}]

"My question was unheard, or ignored."

[woman: {We're just worried about how you're going to get a girl.}]

[me: "You mean here, or when I'm awake."]

[woman: "When you're awake."]

{They became startled and my body began to quake. I lost track of the room and it felt like someone else was moving my limbs in my bed.}

[voice: ("upset") {Your phone got jacked, you need to do a force logout!}]

{I didn't panic and just let the vibrations and stuff subside.}
