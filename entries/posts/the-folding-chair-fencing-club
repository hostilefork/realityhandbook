{I was in the loft apartment where I used to live. Though I didn't have much in the loft when I lived there, it had been redecorated with a modern kitchen and television. On a wall where I'd had a painting I had made, there was a large 3x3 grid of colors dominated by green and white (which I understood as representing one face of a Rubik's cube). The TV was showing a music video intercut with pictures of a monkey holding a videocamera.}

{My dog from childhood was there, and he followed me to the elevator in the hallway. I pushed the button to go to the roof, and also tried the close door button--butnothing happened. Noticing there was a keyhole for a circular key, I fished in my pocket and found a key that fit. When I used it, the door closed and took me to the roof.}

[me: ("to self") {I guess now is as good a time as any to do some matrix training...and just jump!}]

{I jumped off the roof and did a successful landing. Looking back, I noticed my dog running back and forth on the roof...so I gestured to him to jump too. I caught him like someone had thrown me a football, and set him down on the ground.}

{Two extremely large mean dogs that looked like huge rottweilers were on the ground, who began to run at me to attack. When the first came at me, I grabbed it's face and pet it until it turned nice. I did the same with the second.}

{A couple of people came up to me. One man in a suit looked like Agent Smith from the Matrix, and another older guy who was holding several folding chairs.}

[man-in-suit: ("to me") {Nice job, Kane. You're getting good, but you have to learn more combat.}]

[note {I heard the name as in David Carradine's character in Kung Fu, whose name I thought was spelled as "Kane"...but turns out that character's name was spelled "Caine". Upon waking and looking at it, there are many such characters--including the Biblical Cane, considered the progenitor of evil.}]

[chair-guy: ("pointing at the man in the suit") "I'm not going to be as easy on you as he was!"]

{The man handed me one of the folding chairs, and kept the other two for himself. One he poised to use as a weapon, and the other one to use as a shield. I tried to whack him with the chair he had given me, but it collapsed awkwardly.}

[chair-guy: {You have to fold it like this, so it makes a point.}]

[me: ("frustrated") {That doesn't work when I try it. Maybe if you explained what's going on instead of showing me something to blindly mimic. I find that--for instance--in learning dance, it's better to explain the rules and invariants rather than try and memorize specific steps.}]

{The man seemed to change into an Asian woman, and began a sentence. She was grasping for words.}

[woman: "But... but... but..."]

{Noticing she was attractive, I looked at her body. She took notice of my gaze.}

[woman: "Not THAT kind of butt. I mean to say..."]

[me: {I'm going to wake up any moment now. This is a poor way of learning anything, in a general sense, anyway. Can you help?}]

[woman: "This is how it always is."]

[me: {With other people? Well maybe if there was more data it wouldn't have to be that way. You might not know everything, but you clearly know something--share your data. What if I were to be hit by a bus tomorrow? Would this stabilize?}]

"They seemed to get angry at my questioning."

[me: ("annnoyed") {I don't want to fight people with folding chairs for no reason for two minutes each night for a year. Maybe mastering the Matrix is about not wasting my time with people who won't answer my questions.}]

[woman: ("looking at me angrily") "Rupture!"]

{They attacked, and started pinching me viciously. I held out pretty reasonably for a while considering the level of discomfort. I decided to respond by eating my attackers...but had a hard time deciding what flavor they should be in order to make the experience pleasant.}
