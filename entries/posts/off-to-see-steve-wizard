{Feeling a sense of urgency, I flipped through a magazine as I went down a hallway. I passed a bay of wheeled robots that were docked together on a wall in a sort of rack. They looked like Segway transporters, with their bodies tall and narrow like a rod.}

[update [

        {I just saw this video about a rod-like robot that follows humans around hallways:}

        [youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf-i44hoVMQ 420x315]

        {That made me do a double-take, because it matches better than any picture I could find.  But the rods on the ones in my dream were shorter.}

    ]]

[me: "Come with me, I have a manufacturing task."]

{The robots dutifully undocked and rolled in a line down the hall after me. The magazine was open to a page--possibly an advertisement--showing a large black desktop computer.}

[note {Branding on the machine was some weird hybrid of brands we are familiar with, it was something along the lines of "Appledell".}]

{We arrived at rows of lab equipment that looked like large Xerox machines. The robots began plugging into them and causing them to light up, and I showed them the picture I was looking at. A couple people walked in and were distressed.}

[man-one: {What are you doing? You know those are illegal to make.}]

[me: "We need it."]

{He watched warily for a minute, then asked me a question.}

[man-one: {When you set off that nuclear device...did you unplug the aircom transmitter?}]

[man-two: "Oh no! You didn't blow THAT up too, did you!??"]

[note {I'm making "aircom transmitter" up, I don't remember quite what he said. But I understood that he was talking about something used for communications.}]

[me: {Look... I... uh. I have no idea what you're talking about. Or for that matter, I don't know what I'm doing here, honestly. Who are you people?}]

{I went into my usual schpiel about who I am, where I live, that I'm asleep...etc.}

[man-one: ("to man #2") "We need to take him to see Steve."]

[me: "Steve who?"]

[man-one: "Steve Wizard."]

{We walked into a room which looked like someone's bedroom, there was a computer set up and candles. Looking around I didn't see anyone there, but then I noticed a man laying down on the ground on his back with his eyes closed. I walked over to him and crouched down.}

[me: {Are you Steve Wizard? Can you give me any information?}]

{I didn't really notice when or how, but the person lying on the floor transitioned into a thin slightly-older black woman. She was dressed something like a gypsy.}

[woman: {Oh, yes...you are very good. Very good. And cute too, I've always been fond the way the white skin reflects light.}]

"That's about all I remember before waking up."
