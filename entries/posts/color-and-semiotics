{A dream discussion about <a href="http://realityhandbook.org/lucid-dream/critiquing-the-google-aesthetic/">Google's color-coded aesthetic</a> reminded me of my belief in the importance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics">Semiotics</a>. Simply put, semiotics is the study of signaling processes--and how the symbols around us carry meanings.}

{Some people would say that anything can be misinterpreted, and thus everything is arbitrary. Yet in my view, meaning can be constructed and applied. I think that using symbols carefully can improve the chance of meaning being preserved when an object is taken out of context, or modified. Doing a proper job gives us discernment and builds worlds where communication is possible.}

[note {I do know the CIA thinks pretty carefully about how to make flyers, such as these <a href="http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=30">warnings which were scattered all over Hiroshima</a> prior to bombing it.}]

{Look at this picture of hot and cold water taps both drawing off of a cold water pipe, where the labeling of red and blue have no meaning:}

{I often feel like the uneducated villager in a country without running hot water who goes to the store and puzzles over the red and blue taps they sell.}

[me: {I need yellow. That would coordinate with the color scheme in my bathroom.}]

[merchant: "These come in red and blue only."]

[me: "Could you order me a yellow one?"]

[merchant: {I have never seen one. We can't special order, the taps we get are dropped from the sky and always are blue and red.}]

{Perhaps I'd go all over to every shop in town trying to find a yellow one, only to see that I can't get anyone to sell me anything other than red or blue. But perhaps at one store I see an interesting thermometer.}

{I may draw the conclusion that the taps were constructed in a place that has not only cold water infrastructure, but some kind of hot water infrastructure. But with no way to prove it, because no one in my country believes such a thing exists. I'm stopped at every turn because I have no way to get out of the country without being shot at the border.}
