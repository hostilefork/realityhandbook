print {I was looking at a computer terminal with some guy.  A thing I had seen on the screen--which I don't have recollection of--had gotten me upset.}

dialog [
    me: "Can't you...can't you take that?  Can't you get it out...carry it back, so your incarnation remembers it?"

    man: <shrugging> "Nope.  I don't know how.  And even if I could, I wouldn't want to."

    me: <frustrated> "Why not!?"

    man: "Are you serious?  When you think about your own situation, do you think it's *better* or *worse* to know about this stuff?  It seems to me if you remembered less, you wouldn't be so tormented."

print {Him bringing up the topic of "my situation" caused me to get my bearings.  I snapped out of whatever thought train I had been on, becoming lucid enough to question the environment.}

dialog [
    me: "Hold up...wait, *where are we*?  What is happening, what is all this?  Why would I remember or forget any of it?"

    man: "I'm really not scoring any points here, not enough to be anyone people would know about.  But *you*, my friend, are the biggest player in this space."

    me: {"The space" of what?}

print {He looked at me, thoughtfully.}

dialog [
    man: "Though it's not a word most would think to use describing someone doing this kind of work--in my opinion it's fair to say: you are a *trendsetter*."

    me: "Trendsetter at what?"

    man: "At being *good*."
