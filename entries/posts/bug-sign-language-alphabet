{I was fighting and the visuals went blank as I begged for it to stop. Then at one point I felt someone take one of my hands. I reacted positively to this, and by waving my other hand I got them to take that. Then I got them to take my feet. I was being held--it felt like--and the assault on my middle area had ended.}

{Some creatures that looked like animated bugs a la Pixar appeared. They were saying praiseful things.}

[bug: "His methods are those of the wisest communicators."]

[note {I felt the comments were directed to me, but I could be wrong.}]

[bug: {We are going to show you a video. Whenever a break in the dialog happens, like if they say 'um', we'd like you to identify that.}]

{I was shown some odd thing that looked like a Sesame Street episode. I waited until "Um" happened and then I would say Um and signal a "U" and an "M" in the sign language alphabet. One animated bug started reflecting the sign language alphabet at me (a, b, c) to show they knew what I meant.}

{This was followed by an odd period of floating down some tunnel with a lot of purple dots raining on me.}
