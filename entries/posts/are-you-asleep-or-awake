{I was talking to my old college roommate, as we walked around a mall-type area that seemed like it was in a Las Vegas casino.}

[me: "Are you awake or asleep?"]

[roommate: "I'm asleep."]

[me: {What I really want to know is...what kind of mall is this, and have you figured out how things work here in dreams?}]

[roommate: {I'm not sure what you mean by 'figured it out'. But I have come to realize that there is no death. You just start living in worlds to which you have fewer and fewer attachments.}]

{He went away and I poked around inside a ritzy restaurant. Meeting a group of strange beings, I mimed the question at them while talking.}

[me: "Y'know, are you guys asleep...or Awake?"]

{I did a gesture to indicate my head on my hands like a pillow, and then held my eyes open to evoke "asleep" and "awake" for them. A human-looking guy wearing a crown did some interpretation for the other weirder looking beings. They nodded, shrugged, and walked away.}

[king: ("to me") {You do realize you're 'awake' right now, right? Your *body* is sleeping, but *you* are awake.}]
