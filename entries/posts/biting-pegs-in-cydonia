print {I was in a house with people, and began asking them questions:}

dialog [

    me: "Have you heard about Earth?"

    them: "We saw something on *360* about it."

]

note {I somehow understood 360 as being an investigative reporting program, a la CBS's [60 Minutes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes). Interesting, both 360 and 60 indicate full rotations around a circle, but one is degrees and the other is minutes.}

dialog [

    me: "What details do you know? Where are we now?"

    one-man: {Don't tell the special person too much about what is going on.}

]

note {I felt the sense in which they were using the word "special" seemed to be "handicapped", because of the negative tone, but I may be misinterpreting.}

dialog [

    me: {Don't worry about giving me information, I can handle it. I've seen *The Matrix*, I'm ready for pretty much anything.}

    someone: <angry> {Come on, you're from Cydonia(?)! You've got enough privileges as it is!}

]

note {There are a few things to which the term [Cydonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cydonia) applies. This includes the Greek Goddess of heroic endeavor, an asteroid orbiting the sun, and the infamous 'face' on Mars. None of these were known to me prior to the dream.}

print {The exchange continued to be frustrating, so I went into another room where the people were nicer. They expressed dismay at the other people and tried to explain some things they had been saying.}

dialog [them: {When you thought they said 'bite peg' they were actually using an idiom, that one about 'biting one's leg'.}]

note {Perhaps this was supposed to be 'pulling one's leg'...meaning to joke?}

dialog [them: "Don't go back to that room. Sleep in here with us."]
