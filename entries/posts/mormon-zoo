print {Having become lucid, I was in a discussion with a young boy about where he was from relative to me.}

dialog [
    boy: "What planet are you from?"

    me: "Earth"

    boy: "Where is that?"

    me: "Ummm.   Milky Way Galaxy.  I dunno how useful that is, as it's a term that comes from Earth.  It's the third planet from a sun, if that's any help."

print {He pulled up a big starmap on a screen.  I looked at it blankly.}

dialog [
    me: <sheepishly> "Ummm.  I guess I should have at some point memorized some kind of fundamental properties like the ratio of the planets from the sun or something, if you're going to search."

print {I stopped to look more closely at the "starmap".  When I did, it seemed like it was a video game with space battles going on.}

dialog [
    me: <skeptically> "Are you *sure* that's a starmap, and not just a screen in some video game?  Because that seems a bit too pixely and has cartoon ships fighting on it.  Where are YOU from?"

    boy: "The Mormon Zoo."

    me: "Uh... what is that?"

    boy: "It's in some of the older cores, a simulation."

    me: "The name 'Mormon Zoo' doesn't sound like the people running it are pro-Mormon...are they?  Who runs the simulation?"

    boy: "It's kept active by a corporation by contract."
