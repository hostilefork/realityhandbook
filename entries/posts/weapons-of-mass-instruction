{Was at the entrance to the apartment building where I am staying, and the manager was speaking to some people about someone who was 70 years old but looked 50. Some other people were around, including a man in a military uniform and an older man who was being called "Mr. President". I recognized this as George Bush Sr.}

[note {I don't think he really looked like George Bush Sr. or not, but in this context he was supposed to be an older former president.}]

{I shook his hand and said hi in a friendly way, but shifted quickly toward a joking and mocking manner.}

[me: {So you're the third president to be coming around this building today! And here we have... let's see, a major general?}]

[military-man: "*Sargeant* major general."]

[me: ("amused") {If I remember correctly, that's considered an even bigger deal. What are you guys doing here?}]

[military-man: "We're not going to discuss that."]

[me: {AND it's a SECRET! Wow, tons of important people coming by such a cheap residence--nothing special about it at all. I can't think of one reason they'd be interested except...wait...}]

"I made a gesture of exaggerated false realization."

[me: "Wait a minute! *I'M* HERE!"]

{At this point I made an ominous face and glared, pointing.}

[me: {Well I don't want you important people to stress yourselves so much with long trips to my apartment. Because very soon, we'll be bringing what's in this apartment *to you*.}]

{Then I turned to walk back to the building. A younger man who had been walking along with us commented to the group.}

[young-man: {We have confirmed that the building contains weapons of mass *instruction*.}]

[me: ("stopping") "You could put it that way. I kind of like that."]

[young-man: {When the Chemical Brothers told me what was going on here, I didn't believe them. This is going to blow people's minds...literally.}]

[note {The Chemical Brothers are an [electronic music group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chemical_Brothers).}]

"He tapped the side of his head with his finger."

[young-man: {But I don't know if I'm ready. Guess it doesn't matter if I'm ready or not.}]

[me: {Being a little smarter never hurt anyone. Or did it?}]
