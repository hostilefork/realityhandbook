[{I was watching some sort of story unfold where Bill Gates was in an argument with a female employee over something on her computer. After she had left he enlisted the services of a woman from another department to hack into the files. The interface of the software the woman was using was very advanced.}]
[bill-gates: "Where did this software come from?"]
[woman: {We got it from the vendor who sold us the system for HR.}]
[bill-gates: "I'd like to talk to them."]
["He turned to me, and said:"]
[bill-gates: {In case you're curious, we've only just shipped Word 2.0}]
[me: "Ah. Definitely something fishy going on here then."]
[{I became lucid and for some reason thought it was a communication with the real Bill Gates.}]
[me: {Wait, are you going to remember this conversation? Do you remember your dreams?}]
[bill-gates: {Oh there is a whole collection of people who remember what you've said to them. In fact, there's a documentary being made by HBO about you.}]
[{The scene faded and I was walking down a hallway with someone else.}]
[me: {Someone said a documentary was being made about me on HBO. What is it?}]
[man: {I've heard about it, I haven't seen it. It's titled <i>'Where I Go To When I Am Called'</i>.}]
[note "Title approximated, it was something like that."]
[{I became nervous as I was led into a closed off room with a lot of people and medical tools.}]
[me: "Whoa, whoa, what are you planning on doing here?"]
[man: "It is time for the swallowing of the red poison."]
[me: {Is that necessary? What have I done to warrant being poisoned?}]
[man: "No, no. *YOU* are the poison!"]
[me: "I don't understand."]
[man: {Whenever we touch you, it is very painful. We understand it is painful to you as well.}]
[{Someone from across the room reached at me and gave me a brief poke, his arm stretching like PlasticMan. It felt like an injection. He retracted his arm immediately.}]
[me: {Wait, so that feeling... like an injection that I'm always getting, it's just a by-product of touching? And you feel it too?}]
[man: "Yes."]
[me: {Then... well... can't we use science here? Like, you could take some skin samples or blood, whatever. Figure out why it happens, and then stop it. Then we can talk normally.}]
[man: "This new king is showing much wisdom."]
[me: {Er... well I'm not trying to hurt you. Study what you can while I'm here, I can take it.}]
[{A stack of Petri dishes were brought in. I walked over to the table, which had become something like a fume hood.}]

[{Holding my arm out, I noticed that it looked like nothing but a circuit board. They were trying to detach it completely, but using physical force.}]
[me: {Hey. Well, if you want that thing, could you use scissors or something? Just cut it off...this twisting hurts.}]
[{They did, and I noticed that my arm suddenly went from feeling like it was the circuit board to functioning normally again.}]
