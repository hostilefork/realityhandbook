{Walking outside of a house I was in, I found myself to be on something called "Jeff Street". There was a sign indicating the direction of Stanford University. Seeing no other place to go, I went back in the house and addressed a group seated at a table.}

[me: "What state are we in?"]

[someone: "Lorena."]

[me: "That's not a state. Do you mean Louisiana?"]

[someone: "No, Lorena."]

[me: {Okay, I'm going to pronounce this carefully and you tell me if it's right. LOR-EEN-AH.}]

[someone: ("mockingly") "You don't need to say it that way, it's not Latin."]

[me: {I saw a sign outside for Stanford. Is it the closest university?}]

[someone: "No, it's the second closest."]

[me: "I'd like to know what you've heard about Earth."]

"A middle aged woman at the table perked up."

[woman: "Ah, Earth. Yes, I spent 500 years there."]

[me: {Um...okay, so on Earth--where I am from--that would be considered an impossible lifespan. Almost no one lives past 100.}]

[woman: {No, it's up to everyone how long they spend there. You can stay as long as you like.}]

[someone: {What's interesting about Earth is that the planet is constructed out of digital lines, but it has an atmosphere that prevents queen eggs from being laid. That keeps it protected.}]
