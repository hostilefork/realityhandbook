{It was raining, and I boarded an empty bus with a friend from High School. There was no driver, the doors opened automatically for us.}

[me: {Hmmm, it's like...I don't know how to spend my time anymore in dreams, situations like this. Let's see...}]

{A colorful circular symbol was painted in the center of the floor of the bus.}

[me: {Well let me see if I can make that symbol move from the floor to the ceiling.}]

{I focused fairly hard and visualized it happening, telekinetically. The symbol began to peel as if it were a sticker and fluttered up onto the roof of the bus, but it didn't look like it would stick. I had to walk over and use my hands to flatten it.}

[me: "That wasn't bad at all."]

{Somehow this transitioned to where I was in a living room with attached bedrooms, naked. I could hear someone about to open one of the bedroom doors, so I grabbed a giant orange towel and wrapped it around me. A thin man who identified himself as dimitri walked in.}

[me: "Ah, you almost walked in on me with no clothes."]

[dimitri: {Yes, well everyone has to get dressed sometime. The next time maybe the tables will be turned, and it will be me who is the deaf one.}]

[note {His remark about deafness was something I just ignored at the time, but it could be that he was aware of my dreaming state and knew I didn't have all my senses operating.}]

[me: "How do you like living here?"]

[dimitri: {It is okay, it has a great view. But that doesn't mean too much to have a nice place without a girl around to show it off to. Do not get me wrong, I had one two years ago. But you need too much money these days...and I don't feel the need to...}]

{He gestured in mid-sentence at a magazine on the table. It had a title like <i>Start your own Amazon-style successful business.</i>}

[dimitri: ("annoyed") "...start my own Amazon-style successful business."]
