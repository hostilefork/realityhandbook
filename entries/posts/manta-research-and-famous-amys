print {I was in what seemed like a hotel room, where I picked up a small iPhone-looking device.  I decided to talk to it.}

dialog [
    me: "Hey, phone... um... show me a map of how to get out of this building."
]

print << [
    {I walked out the door and passed a strange looking robot.  It seemed to have some kind of sign for a face.  Remaining calm, I passed it peacefully, and it didn't bother me.}

    {Trying to make sense of the map, I noticed a man who looked like a construction worker push an elevator button on the wall.  Nonchalantly I followed him, but when the elevator came it was rather shallow and wide.}
]

dialog [
    construction-worker: "Hm, is the main elevator not working?"

    me: <playing it cool> "...it might not be..."

print << [
    {Fumbling with the phone it seemed to be able to expand into a wallet, and had some kind of built in lighter.  Looking into the wallet, it appeared to be full of a lot of large bills.  I discreetly closed it back up.}

    {Fearing the usual dream attacks, I didn't want to look suspicious.  So I decided to make small talk.}
]

dialog [
    me: "So...how's your day?"

    man: "About as good as it gets?  Had a meeting, and I feel like I can't get anywhere because I'm always getting judged on how I look.  Maybe I should wear fancier shoes."

    me: "Well, if someone judges you on your shoes, then you have a piece of information of what kind of person they are.  I'd just turn it around and judge them for it."

    {He smiled and we walked outside, passing an opening area of a building that seemed to have some restaurants or stores built into its bottom level.  I walked out into the dark, and turned around to try and see the context of where I was.  A sign on the outside said **Amy's Roadhouse**}

    {I tried talking to the phone some more, but now--for some reason--it talked back.  It seemed to punctuate what it said with laughter.}
]

dialog [
    phone: <laughing> "It's owned by the Radisson Group."

    me: "So it's like, a hotel?  Are the units all rented, or owned, or what is it?"

    phone: <laughing> "You have to pay to stay there."

    me: "Yes, but I mean, what kind of building.  Is it all hotel, or mixed residential and hotel?"

note [
    print {I'm not sure why of all things I would care about the zoning makeup of the building I'd come out of.}
]

print {I wandered about staring at the phone's map, and decided to go into a local shop to see what I could learn about the body I was in before I woke up.  I addressed the female shopkeeper, starting with some kind of innocuous-seeming questions.}

dialog [
    me: "Do you remember seeing me before?"

    woman: "Yes."

    me: "Do you know what I do, like, for a living?"

    woman: "I don't know anyone that knows you've said anything about it."

    me: "Would you say this area is a good area?  Is it high end, average, or is it dangerous or something?"

    woman: "It used to be sort of the second nicest neighborhood around here, because of Manta Research.  Maybe not quite as nice these days, but still good."

note {"Manta Research" sounds like the name of some supervillain's cover company from a comic book or movie.  However, pretty much every organization I can find on Google calling itself "Manta Research" is very literally involved in researching mantas, e.g. the aquatic fish.  I suppose that could still have a villainous angle to it.}

dialog [
    me: "Okay, well, let me tell you the situation here.  I don't know anything about this place.  I don't recognize this place, this city, the room I was in before, 'Amy's Roadhouse', 'Manta Research' the phone I'm carrying... none of it.  Basically, the way you could model this is that I'm an amnesiac, except... I'm not.  I have an entire life that I know about, it just is unrelated to whatever this one is."

    woman: <shrugging> "It's pretty easy to get hacked.  You just read a few pages, and next thing you know, whoosh."

    me: "Sure, I'm a programmer.  And I get that.  But it seems if anyone's been hacked, it would be the body I'm occupying...not me, the occupier.  I'll wake up fine in a minute--near certain, regardless of attacks.  I just have no idea how I got connected in here, wherever here is."

    woman: "The one person who knows about your situation is Rohit.  He knows, but he just can't say anything."

    me: "Who?"

    woman: "Rohit...of Famous Amy's and Michaels."
