    {I approached an attractive Amazon warrior-looking female avatar (in the vein of Xena: Warrior Princess).  She was somewhat perfectly "rendered" looking, though we were physically in a sort of natural outdoor setting.}

    {Realizing it was a dream I began asking questions.}

dialog [
    me: {I'm asleep, hence I have to ask, what are you?}

    amazon: {I'm a *character*.}

    me: <suggestively> {Okay...*character*.  So what would happen if I took your clothes off?}

    amazon: <slyly> {Are you trying to ask if I'm "anatomically correct"?}

    me: <embarassed> {Uh...you can interpret the question how you want.}

    amazon: {Well, with my clothes *on*, you can see I have *at minimum* a nose and a mouth.  You're saying that can't be enough to...satisfy you...r question?}

    me: <laughing> {Okay, sorry.  Sorry.  It's just kind of annoying to have to worry about manners in the dreamworld.  As if there's not enough to worry about.}

print {At some point the conversation changed to speaking to an ordinarily-dressed woman.}

dialog [
    woman: "You're one of those guys who wants to keep going to college perpetually.  You seem to think that starting over and over is the ideal way to be."

    me: "Starting over, as in death and reincarnation?"

    woman: "That too, I guess.  But the afterlife really is the same as any reunion.  Just a time to go and visit with people, and reminisce about however things went down."

print {I was spitting up some kind of strange red substance.  But a guy came and took it from me, as if he wanted it or thought it valuable.  The woman persisted asked a lot of leading questions about my relationships, and then changed the subject:}

dialog [
    woman: "The only thing that gets logged as a penalty is smoking.  But you don't do that, so...anyway.  If you wanted to cause a trace by using those penalty records for data gathering--too late.  But I know you don't care."

    me: "Huh?  Why would smoking be called out in particular?"

    woman: "Long...story.  Anyway, the main point I'm making is that while you've broken quite a number of rules, none of that is going to matter if you just get your batteries reset.  You'll be as good as if you were new."

    me: "If I had a battery, why would I have to eat?"

    woman: <sighing> "For a smart guy, you really don't know much.  There's other directions: Ether, and now with Quantum Mechanics it's even expanded, to Q-Ether"
