{There was a part in a dream where I was non-lucid, playing a video game that was some kind of monochrome variant of the video game [Cloak and Dagger](http://www.atariprotos.com/8bit/software/cloakdagger/cloakdagger.htm) at an arcade. Every 100,000 points there was some sort of policy that I would win a plastic container full of popcorn, but I had to fill this container myself. I started stressing over the precise policy... like, was it every 100,000 points on a single quarter or was it every full game played for a quarter where the total score exceeded 100,000?}

[note {This was not lucid, and I only report it to give some context.}]

{After this I was trying to drive a car and it was out of control. I couldn't stop at stop signs and generally I was concerned about navigation because I didn't know where I was. It began to float, and I was somehow on the road hanging onto the car above me... when I decided to just let it go. It went flying into the air like a balloon.}

{As I stumbled onto the sidewalk, I ran into an older black man. I greeted him and mentioned that it was too hard to hold onto the car, so I just let it go. We embraced, as some men came up the street.}

[me: {If you help me, you can have the car. Or whatever. I just need information.}]

[men: {We need the keys. We can't take the car without the keys.}]

{Reaching into my pocket, I emptied the contents. I handed over a backpack I was carrying as well. The black man began writing on my hand with a sharpie.}

[black-man: "If you need me, here's my contact information."]

{As he started to write, he noticed that the word "negative" was written on my hand already.}

[black-man: <raising his brow> "That changes things."]

{He thought a little, then scratched out what he had written and wrote something else.}

[me: {Is that some kind of code? How can you be sure you've read everything you need to read? What if it's a... double negative?}]

{He and a group of people led me to a nearby shack-like structure. They began some kind of process of gently spinning me and carrying me, which kept me in the dream. They seemed good.}

[me: "Have you ever seen the movie *A Scanner Darkly?*"]

[someone: "I think I saw that one, yes."]

[me: {Well, if you watch it, that's what I feel like. I wonder if I've made some kind of choice, or if I'm involved in some kind of strange project I don't remember getting involved in. Is there hope for what I'm doing here?}]

[someone: {I'll say what you are doing is something that has definite potential.}]

[me: {I'm going to wake up, and that's going to be the end of this conversation. Unless you have something you can do.}]

{A man with a full bottle of water sprayed it on someone else, it made a big splash. When he sprayed it on me it felt like air.}

[me: {That looked like water when it was splashed on the other person. When you splashed it on me, it felt like air.}]

[someone: {You're going to have to learn to fail at some things.}]

[someone: "So far you have done very, very well."]

[me: "What year is it here, where you are?"]

[someone: "Hope springs eternal."]

[me: {That's not what I would call a 'time'. Like, the year 2007, or... two o' clock on Easter Sunday. Those are what I would call 'times'.}]

{I remarked that I'd just felt a sudden rush of blood to my hands, then I woke up.}
