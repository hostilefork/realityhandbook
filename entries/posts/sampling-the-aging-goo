print {As is often the case, I was spitting out a lot of goo from my mouth.  I kind of wadded it up and complained, and handed it to a woman.}

    me: "What's WITH this stuff that's always coming out of my mouth in dreams, anyway?"

print {She took it from me and rubbed it on herself.  Her hair fell out and she aged very rapidly--first becoming old, then a mummy, then a skeleton...and collapsed.}

dialog [
    me: <aghast> {Well, jeez, I'm sorry!}

    mummified-skeleton: {No, it's interesting!  This is about giving you *options*.  Isn't it important to see all the different ways of being?}
]

print {What remained of the mummy/skeleton then broke into song.  I don't remember the lyrics, but the gist was that in the end, you'll eventually see all the options--so you might as well try everything when you can.}
