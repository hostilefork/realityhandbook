dialog [
    colbert: "Don't you want to meet your maker?"

    woman: "To the extent I have a maker I've met them, my parents."

    colbert: "I hope you've never seen, let's say, an insect...as a mere outgrowth of your own human-centric philological conceptions."

    me: <interrupting somehow> "Wait, *never*?  If you don't believe in a simplified model, and then later learn it's more complex than you thought and see it in a deeper way, then you don't get that feeling of realization."

    colbert: "What I meant, was..."

    me: "What you SAID was you hoped everyone was born with perfect beliefs, as you apparently were.  But for my part, I hope you *sometime* have the experience of learning something profound.  It's fun."

    colbert: <laughing> "Well, I *hope* if you continue this train of thought you do so more quietly, because there are people upstairs sleeping and if you wake them up that's going to be a problem."
