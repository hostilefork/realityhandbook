{Somehow I wound up talking to a very small child--nearly a baby--outdoors near a large pool. Despite the apparent age, this child had the aura of a mature adult. We spoke through a kind of seeming telepathy.}

[me: "What can you tell me?"]

[child: {Really we've tracked it down to [person]. So we're going to have to go back in time and fix when he intervened.}]

[me: {Go back in time eh? Well I guess if it's possible, we'll be wanting to do that more than once!}]

[child: {Yes, we can put in a freeze byte, there will be opportunities.}]

[note {I don't remember the word used to modify "byte", but it was some word I wasn't familiar with seeing associated with "byte"--which is the technical term for a small amount of computer memory, which is enough to store an integer value between 0 and 255}]

[me: "Hm, what is a freeze byte?"]

{The child looked at me with some surprise and a concerned affection.}

[child: {Baby, if we're talking...you should have your memory back! Otherwise, how can you be here?}]

[me: {I'm sorry but I don't know. Maybe I've lost my mind and it's not coming back.}]

{Our conversation was cut off when the lights in the room suddenly went out, and some kind of fisherman came along and attacked someone else--but left me alone. A Golden Retriever came along and picked me up onto its back somehow, and started carrying me along. It took me along a path to a very nice house and threw me onto a bunk bed of some kind. The only help I could offer was to open a door somewhere along the way.}

{Once I'd gotten out of bed I summoned the dog and praised it for doing a good job. It seemed to like being petted as an ordinary dog would. I walked along and came across a woman in a kitchen.}

[me: "Where are we? What is this place?"]

[woman: {It's kind of embarrassing actually, but, we live here free. It's Noah's house.}]

[me: "Noah?"]

[woman: "Noah... who founded the Bagel chain."]

[me: "You mean Noah as in 'Noah's Bagels'."]

[woman: "Yes."]

[me: {Okay, that's weird, I know someone else named Noah.}]

{An older-looking man joined us, and there was a bit of an odd scramble to find}

[me: "So what state are we in?"]

[woman: "We're in Minnesota."]

[me: "But where in Minnesota?"]

[man: {No, we're not in Minnesota, don't listen to her. This is Texas.}]

[me: "Okay, but what city?"]

[man: "Chicago, but in the zone R2113."]

[note {R2113 is not what he said, but it was an R followed by some numbers.}]

[me: {All right, that doesn't make any sense to me. I mean, our maps could be all scrambled so we can't communicate. But where I'm from, Chicago is a city in Illinois. And although sometimes there are cities with the same name located in several states, I doubt there is a Chicago in Texas. An example of a famous city in Texas would be, say, Austin.}]

{There was a large colorful map of the world on the floor. I watched as an animation of this map showed the states of the US divided into squares and then reformed in another pattern. Shortly thereafter I woke up.}
