print {I was wandering through an underground bunker and someone was telling me about how I was some kind of leader or prince.}

dialog [

    me: {If I'm a powerful leader here, why is it that I have no memory of it and instead remember an entirely different life while I am awake?}

    somebody: {You had an accident. It affected your memory of this place, which is called Aramania.}

note {There is a bizarre world of warcraft discussion [started by someone named Aramania](http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html;jsessionid=279A654DE9A4FC26E027B308AE2D2AE2?topicId=3168361501&sid=1). It appears to be a word or name associated with the Turkish language.}

note {Upon a review of past dreams, I surprisingly discovered that this [isn't the first appearance of the term Aramania](http://realityhandbook.org/lucid-dream/aramania/), although there wasn't a whole lot of information in the other dream.}

dialog [

    me: "Where is this Aramania located?"

    some-girl: "It is in New Zealand."

    a-man: {New Zealand? Don't be silly. That's not even a holy land.}

    me: {I am from North America. Does that mean anything to you? Have you heard of the United States?}

    a-man: <angry> {Why are you doing this? Why are you trying to make a map?}

    me: {Because I want to connect the dreaming and the waking realms. I want to know.}

print {My perception was that we were in a fortress, and there were snipers who were protecting it. A man walked by with some kind of tray or object that was labeled in bright shiny letters "Hitler".}
