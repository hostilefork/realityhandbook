[{I was sort of floundering out in shapeless dreamspace when I called out for help. Somehow I started descending rapidly feet-first toward the crisp scene of a Mexican restaurant, and was pulled down into a booth. The restaurant was empty except for a shadowy man in a hat who came in and sat down. He had a solid plastic white face and wore glasses.}]
