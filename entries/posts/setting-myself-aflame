{I was at a dinner table, and using sorcery someone turned a dog into a horrific Hell-hound. At first, it continued to obey orders. But then it started going out of control, and I stepped up to intervene. A woman held me back.}

[woman: ("annoyed") "What is your problem?"]

[me: "Well, I always like being helpful if I can."]

[woman: {You only want to get involved because you want more power.}]

[me: {Power is not my issue. Or at least, I want everyone to have power. As long as no one controls the information on how to get power, and people aren't blocked from meeting each other, I'm happy.}]

[man: "I think it's time for a fight. Are you ready?"]

[me: "All right then, let's go."]

"A man challenged me to a fight, and I accepted."

[note {I somehow gleaned that the person I was fighting was a magic teacher, who I was paying to learn tricks. It was also suggested I was paying too much per day for this service.}]

{He had some weapons, but all I did was grab a burning candle off the table. When I saw how unafraid he was of me, I used the candle to set myself on fire and become a flaming fire man. The fire started in the center of my chest, and I pushed forward...consuming my enemy in the flame.}

[note ["I was something like the Human Torch:" [picture %HumanTorch.gif] "...who is a character in the Fantastic Four."]]

{After that, I was in front of a mirror and seemed to have an audience watching. So I extinguished myself, and somehow grew another head out of my neck. I was questioned by the crowd.}

[man: {Do you think you are being shown too much too fast, simply because he wants to create chaos?}]

[me: {I don't know. I don't know anything, really. In fact, I don't even remember how I got here. Can you tell me what you think my name is?}]

{This gave me some strange answers back, including an explicit spelling of my name which started with an M and went on for about 13 letters.}
