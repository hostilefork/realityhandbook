{I'd was floating over a couch, holding a TabletPC of sorts. I managed to push a button on it to get me to sink into my seat, it felt like an old Nintendo Advantage controller in my hands all of a sudden.}

{Getting up I wandered into the kitchen, where I saw a dark-skinned young man. There were hardwood floors, granite countertops, and all the markings of a really nice high-end house. A small bulldog-like dog came running at me and attacking me.}

[me: {Aaaah, dogs! Why do they do this! Real dogs like me.}]

[indian-youth: "He attacks because he is healthy."]

[me: {Well it's not healthy for me if he eats me. How do I fight?}]

[indian-youth: "There are two, turn them on one another."]

{I managed to convince a second dog to come and start attacking the first. The youth just watched. I still had a dog latched onto my wrist.}

[me: {If you can, would you mind helping and getting this thing off me?}]

{He somehow got the dogs off, and they went running with tennis balls in their mouths into another room. He indicated to me that I needed to rub my wrist with my other hand to repair it. I did and it seemed to work.}

[me: "What is this house? Who made it?"]

{The youth looked amused and gestured my attention to a row of green apples on the counter.}

[indian-youth: {Do you believe Adam's apple has... a long, long lineage?}]

[me: {Yes, I suppose. But what I'm asking is, are you seeing this room as I'm seeing it? Or does it exist more abstractly, and I'm merely reinterpreting it through my notion of a house? Is the human form an interface for you?}]

[indian-youth: {All this was built by Him. Because He is the only one there is.}]

[me: "All right, we are all one, sure. But..."]

{I moved a metal thing that had sort of a rough texture a few inches on the counter.}

[me: {Even if I'm just a piece of God, I--*as some bit of God*--find it useful to model the part of me that moved that differently.}]

{A man with white hair approached me and he had a cartoon on a transparency sheet, printed in red. I never saw the cartoon itself. He leaned against the wall and had a pondering, philosophical look.}

[cartoon-guy: ("slowly") {I think... well, I think I have the right way of saying this to you.}]

[me: "Please make it quicker, there's not much time."]

[cartoon-guy: {You've got it right. There's one being, broken down into systems, each with a different function. But sleep is needed. Yet it is not efficient to leave a man unused for 6-13 hours every day. You are seeing some of these other applications.}]

[me: {Okay, I've had this theory--multitasking. My brain is being borrowed in my sleep to do God's work, or, something. So please, if it speeds it up, assume I already know about multitasking and context-switching.}]

[cartoon-guy: {Yes, well, you are '*special*'...but...what we really need from you now--not that we have to focus on this *tonight* if you are not up for it--is something from your soul-mate... your soul-bond partner.}]

[me: {Who would that be? I mean, is this someone I can find? A person I already know?}]

{Some people came in with paper, and tried to communicate a name to me.}

[someone: "Cerul."]

[note {I interpreted this for a time as the idea of my "soul-mate", e.g. the notion of there being some girl out there on the planet destined for me. However, this name has been used in other contexts to refer *to* me, e.g. suggesting that perhaps it's not a person I can find but an ethereal being that works with me in some internal sense. Thrown off by the context and it being an answer I truly did not expect, I decided that perhaps I'd been misinterpreting it and it's the name of someone on Earth. Looking back, it seems like maybe they're saying--well, we're trying to talk to another part of you--a soul partnered with your body. The rest of my line of questioning was on the person-thing, however.}]

[me: {Maybe, a first name? Can you give me an age, location?}]

[someone: "Zabra."]

[me: "Zabra?"]

[someone: "No, not Zabra. Sandra."]

[me: "Sandra? Let's do spellings. S-A-N-D-R-A?"]

[someone: {No, no... it... you had it with the 'Z' but the rest... argh. There was a book published recently under this name, it was popular.}]

{I was called into the next room by someone who suggested I drink as much water as I could. We filled a couple glasses from the tap, and I returned to ask about the name. They looked like they had something, but I woke up before I could get it.}
