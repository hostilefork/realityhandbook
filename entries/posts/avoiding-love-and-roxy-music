{I found an old note I took from a dream, where I was looking at books on a bookshelf. I knew I was dreaming, and so I made a special effort to take in the titles.}

{One was: How to avoid Love, the advice of "Wise Elders", and probably Roxy Music.}

[note {I'm aware of the existence of Roxy Music, but it's not a band I listen to or think of.}]

{Another was: If my life had been five minutes long so far, it would be good again}

{This same dream involved some set of issues of downloading updates to a Windows-based computer. I was helping somehow improve the security of the machine, and I engaged in a conversation with a girl who was very sad:}

[girl: "You mean... there's not just one Microsoft?"]

[me: {Well, Microsoft is just a series of letters... a lot of people would claim to be Microsoft to put a virus on your machine. Any established name or symbol could be picked up and used by someone else who wanted to trade on the reputation of that name.}]

"She began to cry."
