{I had witnessed a rather bizarre scene and then afterward was party to a conversation between two people. They had a rapid exchange and went to depart.}

[me: "Can you go back and say what you had to say again?"]

[person1: "Hey, make sure you go visit Aman."]

[person2: "Ok, sure, I am the shop after all."]

{Walking away with the guy who had proclaimed himself as the shop, I introduced myself and hit him with a couple of questions.}

[me: "Where are we?"]

[person2: "Liarsville."]

[me: {Liarsville? Is that code to suggest that you can't tell the truth in response to my questions?}]

"He sort of attacked me and I woke up."

[note

    {There's actually a place in Alaska called Liarsville..}
