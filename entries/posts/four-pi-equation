{I felt drunk and disoriented, and was in some kind of dark auditorium with a very low stage. Weird Al Yankovic was performing, though I had the sense that this was during a time when this space was usually used for some kind of class. The only reason I was there was to see Al--because usually I wouldn't go to this class.}

{Al took an intermission, and I spoke to one of the kids who was there.}

[me: {Is there information I missed from skipping and not coming in at 9am, when I should have?}]

[kid: {You missed this one lecturer, who was amusing if for no reason than he pissed me off. You know how usually when you see pi^^2 in an equation, you expect to see like... a 4 also, or some power of 4 because it relates to energy?}]

{He started drawing a chart. It had columns, and one was labeled "pass" for the passing energy of a system, then he drew some other symbols like a lightning bolt.}

{**kid** "He kept screwing up the signs in his equations. Saying it would pass when it shouldn't have. I had to correct him! Ha."}

[note {It is sort of the case that 2*pi is a fundamental unit... the number of radians in a circle. If you square that, you would see 4*pi^^2. So it makes some sense, though I don't know of energy equations offhand with 4s in them.}]
