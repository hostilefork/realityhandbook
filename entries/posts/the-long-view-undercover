    {I was accessing my laptop to Google for things I saw in another dream account, but triggered into realizing it was a dream when I saw my Mac Powerbook was a smaller size than usual. There was a girl watching me as I logged in, and we were located on some kind of rolling bed. When I did, there was an video about some new software that had just been installed called "Long View".}

    "Long View"

    {seemed to be some kind of software that interacted with your calendar. Some very impressive animations were running to introduce me to the feature, but I was a bit distracted as I asked the girl some questions about who we were, and what we were doing in this laboratory-type environment.}

dialog [

    me: {The people who see things like this...in dreams...who are they?}

    her: {Some of them are with the government, and have their memory erased to go undercover.}

    me: "Am *I* with the government?"

print {Seemingly cuing off of that, a man walking by with a needle almost injected me. The girl performed some kind of manipulation that re-routed him to inject someone else.}

dialog [her: {That was close. You have to be careful when you talk.}]

print {I asked a few more questions before another guy with a needle injected me. Something made me decide it was important to read his ID badge. At first I read it as Mr Hyde, then Mr...Eide...finally *Eideman*.}

dialog [mr-eideman: <gesturing at us> "Get these cleared out of here."]

print {The needle was painful and causing problems and I couldn't pull it out even though he had backed away. Circumstances changed to where I was in a different medical lab and plugging my passwords into some kind of system.}

note {I got the feeling that my brain was being exploited to try and get these passwords.}

print {Rather than type in my actual passwords, I just started typing long textual messages at the password prompt.}

dialog [me: {Did you think you were going to get away with this? Who did you Bozos think you were dealing with??!}]

    {Some panic ensued. I heard a lot of disturbance with people saying something about a virus in the system. For some reason, I could walk freely around the room I was in, which was filled with medical equipment. I could see the people who were panicking, but they couldn't see me.}

    {Angrily, I tried to disrupt them or knock them over. But when I did, I realized they were not people at all but mechanical devices rolling around on wheels, connected by fluid-bearing tubes. I managed to find some medical scissors on a nearby table and started cutting tubes at random.}
