print {I was watching a music video that was supposedly by the band Nine Inch Nails, entitled "Zootopia".  The video involved people with cat tails who were gesturing at each other.}

note "Nine Inch Nails is a popular electronic band I grew up listening to, run by a musician named Trent Reznor.  Zootopia is the title of a Disney movie about different animals living in a city, where a rabbit becomes the first police officer that's a bunny."

print {The comment section had some remarks from an account attributed to Trent Reznor.  He replied to something I had written and got a notification about.}

dialog [
    trent: <written> "Not sure what you mean by that.  But if what you meant was 'would anyone like to get together and jam and make this kind of music' then I can suggest some good places you might try out in Italy to meet people."

    me: <written> "I have a friend in Italy, though I hadn't thought of going there.  It has a good electronic music culture?"

    trent: <written> "It's all right, but personally I might go back to DC.  Both my parents were spies in the military..."

note {Not according to Wikipedia, as you would expect.  Trent grew up in Cleveland.}

print {The conversation wandered into the legal definition of being a detective who wasn't actually a cop.  We discussed the small lights put on the roof of normal cars to turn them into police cars as not being a real thing--and that you'd only ever see that in movies.}
