print {I was in some kind of college environment, where a professor was in front of a chalkboard peering over his glasses to read admissions essays from potential new students.}

dialog [
    professor: "Oh, this is a classic.  In response to 'what do you want to get out of your college experience' it says they want to 'smoke a lot of carcinogens' and 'do every drug [they] can get their hands on'"
]

print {He wrinkled it up and threw it away.}

dialog [
    professor: {Let's see if we can find an application from someone who isn't homeless, here's one.  It says he used to work for Microsoft, and then an earthquake research center.}

    student: <raising hand> "...uh, are we going to do any math today?"
]

print {The professor drew on the chalkboard a diagram that had an X axis which said "Math" and then a Y axis which said "Sex", then drew an arc across it.}

dialog [
    professor: "So here you can see the correlation between Math and Sex, and what they have in common: the more safe they are, the less fun."

    me: <raising hand> "Uh, is this something you made up just now--or are you copying another one of the things you're getting from the joke applications?"

    professor: "Sorry, did I offend you?"

    me: "Well, I don't care, I'm not easy to offend.  But I'm not everybody"

    {We got into a discussion about solving simultaneous equations, where for every time one person did something, another person would take an action N times.  I was being challenged to solve it...but my head was fuzzy and I thought it was underspecified.}

    {Somewhere in the process of this, computer monitors in the room started to flash and drew the attention of people.}

dialog [
    student: "Ok, that's scary.  Why is that happening?"

    {My high school girlfriend was in the room for some reason, and had been leaning herself and her chair into me previously--but at this point fell over.  I picked her chair up and helped her back into it, with a "okay, stay there" gesture to try and keep her from tipping it any more.}

    {Another girl pointed to some beer bottles that were in the classroom, for some reason.}
]

dialog [
    other-girl: <to me> "You're right, they make a lot of beers you wouldn't expect for a place like this."

    me: <confused> "Uh, I don't remember saying that.  Which isn't to say I don't agree...why's there beer in this classroom?"
