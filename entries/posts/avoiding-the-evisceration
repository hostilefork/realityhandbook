[note {I made it a point to try falling asleep on my back, to see what effect that had on my lucidity. I usually find it difficult to sleep that way, but somehow I succeeded.}]

{I was watching a conversation someone was having with a psychic. The setting reminded me something of the areas in department stores where make-up and perfume are sold.}

[customer: {I really need your services, but I have very little money.}]

[psychic: "I'd charge you $10."]

[customer: "Is there anything you can do for $1?"]

[me: {I hate to interrupt, and I don't really have anything to offer. But I'd appreciate anything you could tell me or show me about where I am. Physically I'm in a lot of pain, and I'm quite disoriented.}]

{Someone offered me a lotion that I put on the back of my neck, which led me to feel better. A man walking by approached me from the back, and I was afraid he was going to do one of the dreaded "tickle attacks" that tend to wake me up. But I realized he was just looking at me in a concerned manner.}

[me: "When I'm attacked from behind, what is happening?"]

[man: {You need to stay away from those places. When that happens, you are being <i>eviscerated</i>.}]

[me: {Oh. Well unfortunately, I have no control over where I wind up when I dream. It's like I just pop into places at random!}]
