[{I was in a disorganized college dining hall, and there were trays piling up various places. It was closing, and I stopped by was a kind of dessert bar.}]
[me: "Is there any cake left?"]
[bartender: "Here's a slice."]
[{Tasting the cake and drinking a bit of coffee out of a shot-glass, I casually started talking.}]
[me: {Not bad, not bad. Well, I'm just dreaming and doing my usual spy work.}]
[{The bartender started looking evil and demonic, like a zombie, and leaped over the bar to attack me.}]
[me: ("jokingly") {C'mon, don't you want to talk to me? I'm not going to stay unless you get back behind the bar.}]
[{I decided to do something humorous. So I speared her in the neck with the fork...but quickly pulled the fork out and calmly used it to continue eating the cake off my plate. That caused a surprise which thwarted the attack.}]
[me: {I have a question to ask you. Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior?}]
[note {I'm not really an expert on Jesus, but perhaps he's got cred in the zombie community because this freaked the zombie out and pacified it.}]
