[{I'd happened across a website called "FDISK", which had a simple type-in-a-string front end (like the Google homepage). It claimed to be some kind of new storage site. Couldn't quite figure out what the nature of it was, but I got an wary feeling that it was something crazy like <a href="http://www.spammimic.com/explain.shtml">SpamMimic</a>. There was a companion program running on my machine called something like "AMC" and it involved typing on a screen with movies playing, and as you typed it would lead squares to appear and disappear for some reason.}]
[{As I realized more and more that I was in dreamstate, I began to wish to learn more about the nature of these programs and what they were doing. I went to look for a help menu, but there wasn't one. There was some kind of "Read documentation for the editor" menu option on the file menu... yet it brought up a dialogue box that said that hadn't been installed. There was an option to "talk to <i>warrior</i>" (which was someone's user name).}]
[{I clicked that, and a chat window opened up. I was greeted by someone who acknowledged me by my waking life name.}]
[warrior: {Sorry but due to various problems it's been delayed.}]
[me: "Please, I need your help."]
[warrior: {Google calendar 2004 doesn't say anything about whether (some user name) will come along in 2007, and even if it does, it might not work out.}]
[me: {Come on, at least explain to me what this program on this dream computer does.}]
[warrior: {Well look, I'd like to go into this right now, because I was once like you, but I'm really tired right now.}]
[{At this point, this guy's life story started coming up in the chat window page by page, with lots of pictures. I had to click enter to get past each one. It was a bunch of tedious stuff, this guy had been born in Sweden, found a bug in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_Construction_Set">Adventure Construction Set</a>, was involved in some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game">Alternate Reality Gaming</a>. I tried to whisk the irrelevant personal history pages away and get to something useful, but instead the tedious stuff kept coming... how he'd been surprised the first time a girl had returned his attentions.}]
[note {I was furious and getting ready to type: "You twerp, I don't want to read your life story, I would never do this to anybody." But I've decided to hold back on hostile responses as best I can, when I can. I don't really know what's going on, someone might send me a URL and my chat program loads up a browser... I might be so disoriented that I'm reading the wrong window while they're typing the useful information in a place I'm not even looking.}]
