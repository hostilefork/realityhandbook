{I find the song and video for Coldplay's "Talk" to be quite moving in a lot of ways:}

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH9meoWmAOM 425x350]

{Plotwise, the band has landed on a desert planet, and Chris Martin is laying on his back...pointing his flashlight up at the sky. It pans across the moon, revealing it as a shoddy illusion hanging against a backdrop. He sings:}

[quote

    "Oh Brother, I can't... I can't get through"

    {I've been trying hard to reach you, 'cause I don't know what to do.}

    "Oh Brother, I can't believe it's true"

    {I'm so scared about the future, and I want to talk to you}

    "Oh I want to talk to you..."

]

{Later he comes across a giant robot and sings to it as it sleeps:}

[quote

    "Are you lost, or incomplete?"

    {Do you feel like a puzzle you can't find your missing piece?}

    "Tell me how you feel..."

]

{At this point, the robot wakes up and sings in subtitles:}

[quote

    "LLEW I LEEF EKIL ER'YEHT GNIKLAT"

    "NI A EGAUGNAL I T'NOD KAEPS"

    "DNA ER'YEHT GNIKLAT TI OT EM"

]

{Which is simply backwards. It then seems that the robot is being helped to find his robot-shaped place to be in, embedded in the side of a mountain. But due to a missing knob on his front chest that was taken by the band while he was asleep, he goes haywire and eats their ship as they're departing.}

{I don't particularly understand the message of that last bit, but I'll hazard a theory. Maybe it's pointing to the idea that the motives for communication are often self-interested... though Chris Martin was speaking rather generally about a desire to talk, he really was just taking a piece of the robot and sending him into a rock. The somewhat insincere-seeming "call me" gesture he sends the robot as he's getting into the ship might indicate that this lost robot isn't actually anyone he wants to talk to. So the relationship turns destructive, despite being born of a mutual desire to talk--just not with each other.}

{But who knows what they meant if they won't say. I saw this video for something called "Piece of mind":}

{It also has a cool [making-of video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5qWG3599Zk), in which the artist talks about how he sees it. Which only reminds me how many more such explanations I'd like to have access to.}
