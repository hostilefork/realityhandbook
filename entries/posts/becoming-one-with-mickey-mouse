{I was speaking to a white man with a beard in a kitchen, who was offering me some brandy and an energy drink.}

[me: "What is your name?"]

[beard-man: "Gladwell."]

[me: "Have we ever spoken before?"]

[beard-man: "Yes, we speak pretty much every day."]

[me: "Uh...what did we talk about last?"]

[beard-man: {You were speaking about becoming one with Mickey Mouse.}]

{There was a strange almost awakening, but ended up back in the same kitchen...this time talking to a black man, who introduced himself to me as Gladwell. He was fiddling around, putting some stuff in the microwave.}

[me: {Wait. You weren't black before. Are you the same person I was talking to before?}]

[black-man: ("sigh") {I really don't know how I can answer that question.}]

[me: {Why don't you just say what comes to mind and I'll try and interpret it?}]

[black-man: "Okay. 'this is not a word', said the sensei."]

[me: {Uh...okay...so you think the question has no meaning. Does it only have no meaning when applied to you? Am *I* a person?}]

{Another strange almost-awakening reset the situation to the kitchen again, this time the beard man was there. He told some people around that I was back, and that I had more questions.}

[me: {So...my question never got answered. Am *I* a person?}]

[beard-man: "No, you're not, because *I* am."]

[me: {Are you being contradictory in order to unask the question?}]

[beard-man: "Un-ask? Oh. Hm. Yes, that's very good."]

[me: {What do you know about the mechanism by which I got here?}]

[beard-man: "Got 'here' from 'where'?"]

[me: "From Earth."]

[beard-man: "Why do you keep talking about 'Earth'?"]

[me: "Well, what would *you* call it?"]

[beard-man: {Pointer offset to pointer delta. Or more essentially 'pointer outside'}]

[note {It is curious to read upon awakening that the very famous journalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell">Malcolm Gladwell</a> had a white father and a black mother...}]
