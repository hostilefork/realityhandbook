print {I was watching a music video that seemed to be shot at night.  It claimed to be for the band "Machines of Loving Grace", for the song "Casual Users".}

note [
    print {Machines of Loving Grace is a band who takes their name from a poem by Richard Brautigan.  I listened to their music in high school.  The song "Casual Users" does not appear to have a music video on YouTube as I see it--the album came out around the time I was graduating college IIRC.}

    {The video was rather morbid.  A guy carrying a briefcase was going through a door in what looked to be a covered bridge, where the structure was made out of straw.  He was oblivious that someone wielding an axe was following him.}

    {One cut in the video showed the axe chopping into a tree, then being removed and leaving blood.  It then cut to another scene where the axe person was graphically chopping the head off the guy's body.}

    {My point of view shifted to another scene where a woman was visiting a young girl in either a sickbed or a hospital.}

dialog [
    young-girl: "I've been having bad dreams."

print {I could somehow see a sort of spooky scene wher wedding dresses in a large closet had come alive, and were going around in circles on their own in a ghostly fashion.}

dialog [
    young-girl: "It's hard to compete with dreams."

    woman: <sympathetically> "Yes.  Sometimes it's hard to compete with dreams."
