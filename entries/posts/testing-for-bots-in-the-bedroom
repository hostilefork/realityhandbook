{A short Asian man in a very star trek like uniform was helping me put on a yellow shirt and button my collar. I wanted to put a gray sweater over this (incidentally, that's what I was wearing to sleep).}

{We were in the interior of some kind of very space age room, clean with walls that looked like gray plastic. He was wearing an orange ID badge that I couldn't read.}

[me: "What do you do for work?"]

[asian-man: ("smirking") "Oh, you mean my bedroom job?"]

[me: "Well, yes, your job."]

[asian-man: "I test for bots."]

[me: {You mean you look for things that are automated, but presenting themselves as if they are not?}]

[guy: "Exactly."]

[me: {But how can you tell the difference? I mean, isn't that fundamentally unsolvable in a sense? Might we all be automated?}]

[guy: {If I answered that, I'd be only speaking from my perspective as a human.}]

{I tried to follow him out of an automatically sliding door, but realized I wasn't wearing any shoes. Turning back to go into the room I faded and awoke.}
