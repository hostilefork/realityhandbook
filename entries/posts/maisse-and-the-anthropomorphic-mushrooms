{Stepping out of a house into a deck area, I saw a man seated in a chair. He was reading a paper and having some coffee. He reminded me of Mario, the video game character.}

[me: "It's-a-you, Mario!"]

[man: ("getting up") "Hey there."]

[me: {I'm sorry if it's strange that I'm picking you out to talk to. Do you think it's strange?}]

[him: {Oh, I don't know. I don't think I'm any less noteworthy than Mario, or a mushroom.}]

{At this point I noticed that there was a giant plastic statue of Mario on the deck, and also a little smiling picture of an anthropomorphic mushroom.}

[note ["The mushroom looked a bit like this:" [picture %anthropomorphic_mushroom.jpg] {...though since the man I ended up speaking to didn't seem to look like Mario at all at this point, these objects may have appeared because of my initial impression.}]]

[me: "Do you have a name?"]

[him: {Well, I don't go so much for names. But how about 'mace'?}]

[me: "Ok, mace it is."]

[him: "Well, see, I'd spell it M-A-I-S-S-E."]

[me: "I can remember that."]

[note {Maisse is a [town in France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maisse) and a relatively common last name, but not so common as a first name.}]

[me: {This place reminds me of my grandmother's house. Are you somehow related to me or anyone in my family?}]

[maisse: "Yes, actually."]

[me: {Um, okay so how do you fit into...the hierarchy? Or not hierarchy, but just what is your relationship to me and my world?}]

{A small kind of dirty child came barreling into us. I stepped away, fearing an attack. But he just looked at me with big eyes and a dumb look. He kind of smelled bad.}

[maisse: {Oh nothing to be afraid of, [name] will take care of him. Hmm. But he is kind of a mess.}]

[me: {All right back on the topic, I mean, to give an example...are you a person who is...dead?}]

[maisse: {No, no. But I was trying for that this cycle, wanted to see what it was like. I didn't get picked.}]

[me: "How can you be picked to be...dead?"]

[maisse: {Well, it's just a thing you can do, it takes about 50 years. Unless you do the roller-coaster and then it's over in two.}]

[note {I don't know if he meant a literal roller-coaster, or if he was suggesting that there was some sort of process for expediting one's process by rushing it some other more metaphorical way.}]

[me: {So...okay, in this position of dead or not dead and descriptive terminology for what people are, what am *I*? And why is it that I'm here mapping out territories of the cosmos that no one from my world seems to know about?}]

[maisse: "You're a programming person."]

[me: {That's something I do, but...I mean, am I somehow different biologically from people with other skills or jobs? Like...someone who repairs telephones, they'd be technical maybe but would they not be a 'programming person'?}]

[him: "Right."]

{Another guy was in the room sitting in a chair, who disagreed with this position. And I woke up.}
