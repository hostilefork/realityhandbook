    {I found a magazine on the ground that was built like a box. It seemed to be some kind of cross between advertisement and pornography (in the spirit of a Victoria's Secret Catalog, I suppose). Picking it up, I went into a house and sat on a sofa...hiding the magazine.}

    {Two young children knocked on the door and came in. They were looking for the magazine. I dug it up and gave it to them, and they mentioned something about a "candy contest".}

note {The mention of candy contest reminded me of a dream from a long time ago, reading someone's Livejournal interests named [jadebob](http://realityhandbook.org/lucid-dream/jadebob-and-the-candy-contests/), which brought up the term. This made me lucid and I started asking what a candy contest was.}

dialog [

    me: {Wait. Candy contest. I've heard of this before. What is it?}

    kid: {You have to solve puzzles, and they plant clues all over the world.}

    me: "You mean it's like an alternate reality game?"

    kid: "It's a story. And if you win, you get a prize."

    me: "Who gives you the prize?"

    kid: <rolling eyes> "The CANDY COMPANY, of course!"
