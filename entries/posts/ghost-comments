[{I was dreaming that I was reading comments on this journal. One was a spam comment which surprised me because this journal never gets spam--it's sufficiently zero profile that search engines can't find it... how could a spam engine find it?}]
[{Another comment was from someone named "Shawna" who said we had met in some forest. It was possibly a hiking trip, and she mentioned that she was the Asian girl. She had commented and wondered why I didn't reply but she was commenting again. I was confused because I'd never received email notice of a comment to know to check... and because I had no idea what event she was referring to.}]
