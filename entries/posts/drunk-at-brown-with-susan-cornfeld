print {I was at some kind of dance club which had narrow stairways of mesh metal for getting from one area to another. They were something like fire escapes. While descending I was speaking to a girl who was traveling along with me.}

dialog [

    me: "I should have known it was a dream from earlier."

    her: "How do you ever know for sure?"

    me: {Good question, I mean, what is a 'dream' anyway. But there are instabilities, for example, your hair color changed between the top of the stairs and here.}

    her: "What were you doing drunk at Brown anyway?"

    me: "Huh?"

    {She started looking like someone else I knew from the past, and others in the club started looking like familiar faces as well. I began asking if it was possible for anyone to get me information about the real people who they were resembling. I didn't get much, but at one point someone mentioned the name "Susan Cornfeld" right before I had a false awakening.}

    {Believing myself to be in my room and using my computer, I decided to look up Susan Cornfeld. When I did, there was a page that was very fancy--a well laid out hi-tech portfolio of someone who seemed to dabble in a lot of different areas (music, technology). Checking my inbox, it was full of mail--much from people I don't know.}

dialog [me: <frustrated> "Who are all these people?"]

print {Someone, a guy, was now in my room and whispering in my ear. I was cued into realizing that it was still a dream.}

dialog [

    me: "Hey, speak up, I can't hear you!"

    guy: <annoyed> {Look. If you do believe the Matrix is real and all that, and that we need to be careful...couldn't you try being a little more discreet?}

    me: "Not my style. Someone has to shout."

    guy: "Well you need a hard line."

print {There was now another guy in the room, with a laptop, on my bed.}

dialog [

    me: {I can access the internet from more than one place. I don't see how installing a phone line at my apartment would make any difference. Why don't *YOU* get a new connection?}

    guy-one: {Because it's not *OUR* side that has the problem. It's yours.}

    guy-two: "We need you to run Skype."

]

print {I noticed there was an icon on the computer that was labeled Skype. The icon was incorrect--it was the icon for the audio editing program Audacity. I clicked it.}

dialog [

    guy-one: "I didn't realize there was Skype on this computer."

    me: {Well, for your information, the icon isn't correct. That's the icon for an audio editing program called Audacity. You might want to get a copy of Skype from somewhere else.}

print {A small dwarfish man came in the door. He made me nervous, so I trapped him between the door and the wall. He was strong--so he pushed it back open to get out--and looked mad. The two guys on the bed told him to leave the room. He hesitated and they became more menacing, saying "you've been warned!" I shut the door after he left.}

dialog [

    me: "Who the heck was that?"

    guy-two: {Oh, they work in the building...they've been here a long time.}
