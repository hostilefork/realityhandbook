{I was driving by a place that was something like a YWCA, but it had been done up with decorations for some kind of party/fundraiser. So I stopped the car and wandered inside to look at it. They were selling tickets for the event, which was on the 14th.}

[note "I somehow knew this to be a few days away."]

"One of the organizers greeted me warmly."

[organizer: "Hi there! Welcome!"]

[me: "Oh, thanks!"]

[organizer: "We're curious...how did you hear about our event."]

[me: {I was passing by, and the decorations outside drew me in to check it out.}]

[organizer: {Oh? Really? Glad you like them, but it's really nothing special yet.}]

[me: {Well I really like all the ferns you have. The stage lights really accent them...}]

{Though I was enjoying showing the organizer the things I liked about their decorations, it was about time to leave. So I returned to my car. A few people followed me out and continued chatting.}

[note {The car reminding me a bit of the car the [Beverly Hillbillies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beverly_Hillbillies) moved in:} [picture %beverly-hillbillies.jpg] {...because it had no roof, and was stacked with furniture.}]

{Instead of driving the car off, I laid down on a bed that was on the car. A real-life acquaintance bounded in and laid down next to me, and I gave her a quick pat on the back hello. Another woman in the car looked at us furiously. She said something I could not hear to the bouncy girl, and took off.}

[me: "What did she ask you?"]

[bouncy-girl: "She asked if you and I were dating."]

[me: "How did you respond?"]

[bouncy-girl: "I said yes."]

[me: "Oh really?! Since when!?"]

[bouncy-girl: "Since I decided we were, yesterday."]

[note {Incidentally, that is precisely the kind of thing this acquaintance would do.}]

[me: {Well you shouldn't have said that. I think she thought I was out on a date with her right now, so she'll be mad at me.}]

[bouncy-girl: {No, she's not mad at you. She just has issues with her body compared to mine.}]
