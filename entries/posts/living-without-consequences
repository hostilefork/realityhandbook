{Dreaming that I was instant messaging with a girl I haven't heard from in a while. I was in the middle of writing her a kind of angry email when an instant message from her popped up. I already had a partially formed sentence in the IM window that I didn't notice, so when I typed back a greeting that old text was part of the message.}

{Reading how nonsensical the result was, I typed my next line as "Oh, and [all your base are belong to us!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us)", and started to explain what had happened.}

{The next thing I knew we were in a car together, she was more attractive than in real life. We were pulling into a parking lot and going to a restaurant, but I noticed upon getting out of the car that I wasn't wearing any clothes. I panicked a bit about this and reached for a sheet that was in the car, which I put on as a toga. But I noticed she was naked too and was heading into the restaurant anyway.}

{At this point I was pretty much certain that we were in a dream...though something made me feel like it was too real. Figuring at least I wasn't alone if I was wrong, I followed her in. The patrons were not pleased at our attire (or lack thereof), and most of them stormed out.}

[me: "Oh, what's the big deal anyway, it's just a dream."]

[customer: "Everyone knows that girls have germs."]

{I decided we should start having sex, so we did, but were quickly up against the window of the building where people outside could see us.}

[girl: <worried> "The police are coming."]

[me: {Hey, well, at least we've got each other. And if we are awake and having sex in a public restaurant, I think it's time we got some professional help.}]

{The police did come, tapping on the window and asking to have a word with us.}

[officer: "Are you going out-of-body?"]

[me: "What's wrong with being out-of-body?"]

[officer: {Decisions need to have lasting consequences. You can't just come here and do whatever you want and then have it all forgotten the next day.}]

[me: {I completely disagree. Existence is supposed to be an experiment where you can try all sorts of things that cross your mind, and live without having to be in such fear of consequences. That's God's *real* clever design. You're not supposed to be stuck in some rigid 9-to-5 job working for the man.}]

{I walked over to a piano against the wall and started pecking out the melody of the song "9-to-5".}

[note

    {I haven't heard the song in a decade, but its criticism of the typical workday isn't a terrible example to cite:}

    [quote

        "Workin 9 to 5 / What a way to make a livin'"

        "Barely gettin' by / It's all takin' and no givin'"

        {They just use you mind / and they never give you credit}

        "It's enough to drive you / Crazy if you let it"

    ]

    "...but certainly an odd choice."

{There were some other people in the room arguing, and I awoke.}

[note {I woke up quite pleased to have properly assessed it as a dream. The enthusiasm with which the girl and I were able to run about and exclaim the benefits of the fact that it was a dream was unusually reminiscent of [Science of Sleep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Science_of_Sleep)...I don't usually get that sensation.}]
