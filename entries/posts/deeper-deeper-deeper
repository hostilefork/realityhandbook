{At some phase in a longer wandering dream I stopped and saw a small white dog that looked sort of poodle-like against a wall.  He seemed uncomfortable.  For some reason, I decided that he was related to my (now deceased) West Highland Terrier, even though he didn't look particularly like him beyond being white.}

[me: "So, I have trouble with dogs in dreams a lot.  But here, let me pet you."]

{The dog bristled and contorted, baring some sort of bizarre pointy teeth.  It may or may not have bit me...but I steeled myself trying to focus and turn the interaction positive.  I stuck with it and eventually got the dog to lay down to be pet.}

[me: "Now, what you used to have...it was longer straighter fur..."]

{As I pet the dog and recalled what mine had looked like, he morphed to look more and more like him.  He was rolled on his side.}

[me: "And you liked being dried and combed after a bath.  Let's see what I can do, here."]

{Emboldened by the success of drawing the dog form from memory, I conjured the small red travel blowdryer that I'd used to dry him.  I swept the airstream across the length of his body, causing the straight fur to sway as one would expect.}

{Moving the dryer from my right hand to my left...I tried a conjuring trick of physical memory that has worked before.  That's to rub my fingers together until the memory of the wood-handled metal flea comb appeared.  I kept talking as I re-enacted the drying and combing.}

[me: "...the skin on your belly wasn't pink, more gray...and there was fur..."]

{The transformations continued until I decided I was done with that.  I'm not sure it was the dog that morphed or someone/something else in the room that did a transformation into an attractive woman with long black hair and very red lips.  She was reclining on a long and low lounge chair.}

{The woman pulled me close and gave me a very normal-feeling kiss.  I sat down next to her on the floor.}

[me: "See, this is cool.  This is using your mind to sculpt things, getting feedback.  None of the primitive stuff I'm forced to work with.  I think I could be happy somewhere like this, with just a few people who shared my sense of fun."]

[woman: "You'll be here soon enough."]

{The woman got up and morphed into having shorter, lighter hair, walking to a kitchen on the other side of the room.  She began to tinker with something on the stove.}

[me: "But I'm here now.  Isn't there a way I can stay?"]

{A man standing nearby laughed.}

[man: "We've got all kinds of drugs if you want them.  Perhaps you should try some IVN-387."]

[note {I don't remember exactly the name, but it was some letters and numbers.}]

{He went over to a bookshelf and pulled out some object, I didn't know if it was a container or what.}

[me: "What is it?"]

[man: "I'm just kidding.  You don't want this stuff."]

[me: "Why not?  What does it do?"]

[man: "I think of it as a poison, or maybe a pure venom."]

{I noticed there were some iPad like devices around in the room with emails.  The people were shifting a bit, but there were several of them milling around the kitchen.}

[second-man: {I've implanted viewing of all the movies from Earth, and you know what I think?}]

{He began to sing what I perceived to be lyrics from Monty Python's "Always look on the Bright Side of Life".}

[me: {Yes, that's Monty Python... "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life".  I've seen it.}]

[second-man: <confused> {Really?}]

[note {I do not know if it actually was that song, but it was thematically upbeat and along those lines.  Essentially however bad things might get, you should look at the good parts.}]

{I tried to keep up with the motions of people around the kitchen, and came back to the woman who was messing with some things on the counter.}

[me: {If you have been to Earth, who were you?}]

[woman: <pausing to think> "I was... I was a pushy boy."]

{I noticed a figure that looked like my grandfather the surgeon, with black glasses and standing in the middle of the room.}

[grandfather: {Brian!  Do not throw your lot in with these people!}]

[me: {Hello?  What?}]

{Focusing on his face I could see it composed out of seeming pieces of plastic, the glasses built into the face and not being worn on top of it.}

[grandfather: {These 'cool tricks' you are mesmerised by are outlandishly abstracted.  The people in this environment are relying on systems that push amounts of data around that are so gargantuan *it could conceal or contain anything*.  It's layer on top of brittle layer--the very chaotic outcome you are highly attuned to and preach against.}]

{No one else seemed to be able to see him but me.  He seemingly transferred from standing into the room onto a magnet on the refrigerator.}

[me: {Am... I the only one here who can see you?  Do you have anything to do with my grandfather, because that's who you sort of look to be simulating.}]

[grandfather: <ignoring my question> {Beware this!  It is the chaotic endpoint of the backwards technological methodologies of the Earth you know, and a dead end.  If you think you are having trouble now, becoming one of them will create an archaeological nightmare that will just dig you deeper... deeper... Deeper... DEEPER... DEEPER...}]

{As deeper was repeated, it became louder and more resonant.  It created a din of noise that made me vibrate and it was difficult to stay in the environment.  Then I awoke.}
