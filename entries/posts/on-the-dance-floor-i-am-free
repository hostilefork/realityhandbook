{I was on a dance floor, and heard a song I like playing. So I began to dance, while realizing I could perform amazing feats like float in the air and flip. This cued me to start ask questions about how that was possible, and so I started talking to a nearby guy.}

[me: {I can't usually float like this. Have you ever seen a place where when people jump in the air, they immediately fall right back down?}]

[guy: "Oh, you mean like in the old days...on TV?"]

[me: {What do you mean old days? Where were you before you were here, do you remember?}]

"A nearby girl answered for him."

[girl: "All I know is that now I'm free."]

[me: {Is this place somehow in my future? Have you ever seen a robot?}]

[them: "No."]

[me: "Have you ever seen a policeman?"]

[them: "Yes."]

{I was invited into a room where they were going to close the door. If I went in with them, there would be about 7 of us in the room. I didn't want to get boxed in because I was feeling like I was going to wake up, so I tried running around a dance floor but couldn't keep from awakening.}
