print {Having awoken from another dream segment, I was pulled back into it rather abruptly from the darkness up by a woman with long dark hair in a sheer white gown of some kind.  She embraced me and we seemed to fall back on some kind of stairway, with me on top of her.}

dialog [
    woman: "I want you to get a feeling for it, of unbridled lust for me.  Try as hard as you can."

    me: <exhausted> "I...well you're very attractive, but this is not really the best time for me mood-wise, just in life."
]

print {We did embrace a bit and I asked her a question about what her name was.  We went back and forth from where she would say a word and I would say it back, which started as me hearing it as Brutus Plume, but corrected it to what sounded like Brutulus Prume}

note {There is a boss monster in World of Warcraft apparently, which lists "Brutallous" as the name of an Orc Warrior with knives for hands.  She was better looking than him.}

dialog [
    woman: <wistfully> "You should have stayed with Emily longer, I liked that.  That could have been fun.  But you have a tendency to go talking and thinking off in a direction and then it just winds up ending.  I never thought jinxes were real and people had them, but you might."
]

note {I have dated two girls named Emily in my life, and she clarified she was referring to the second--by name.  She was someone who believed she was a channeler, so interesting she would be mentioned by an entity seeming to talk about possession.}

print {During this time she was holding me and I was sort of examining her body under the fabric.  It was a little strangely shaped.}

dialog [
    woman: <directing me to her shoulders> "I always get the ones with these upper arms that are larger than I'd like.  I'd like to get a girl who is narrower above the elbows, looks better."

    me: "So...then...who am I?"
]

print {She laughed.}

dialog [
    woman: "You know those refrigerator magnet dolls that come with the outfits you can put on them...little pieces that come on the square of magnet?  I think your main character modality is what's left after the pieces are taken out.  You dress up as all the shapes at once, in a white outline."
]

print {We were laying on this ground and it seemed like there was a gate and people approaching us looking down at us.}

dialog [
    guy: <laughing> "Jeez, looks like he's going to sinbox her right there."
]

note [
    print {I'd not heard the term as a slang, but unsurprisingly it is used sexually, though not seemingly as a verb.}
]

print {I got up and rearranged our clothes.}

dialog [
    me: "Ummm... sorry, I... don't really know the conventions here.  Being asleep and all.  But perhaps there's some way I could stay longer..."
]

print {And then I woke up *(which sucks, because it would be a good time to not be coming back.)*}
