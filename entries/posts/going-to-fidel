{I had a brief hypnagogic moment in which I was trying to express a desire to continue communicating with a man with very large square glasses. They were almost like flight goggles but being worn ordinarily.}

[goggle-man: "Today?"]

[me: "Yes."]

{This shifted me into talking to a child laying on the ground about something, he was on his back and couldn't move.}

[child: "How did Noah get all those animals onto the ark?"]

[me: {Do you know anyone named Noah other than the Biblical Noah?}]

[child: "Yes...that's how I'm going to get to go to Fidel!"]

[me: "Fidel who? Fidel Castro? Fidelity Investments?"]

[child: {No, Philadelphia. That's where the connective tissue doctor is.}]

[me: "Where is Philadelphia?"]

[child: "It's in Orange County."]

[me: {No, Orange County is in California. Do you know what date it is?}]

[child: "It is November of 1933."]

[me: {If that is correct, then I am from the future. And a lot of things have changed. Mankind has gone to space and landed on the moon.}]
