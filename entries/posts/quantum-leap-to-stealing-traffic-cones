{Had an extended dream in which I was collecting traffic cones off the street with a woman, and talking to her as I did so.}

[me: {You need to understand that I'm not who you think I am. I'm a person who is sleeping, and I'm merely inside the mind of your friend. What's his name?}]

[woman: "Roy."]

[note {I was under the impression that this was something that had happened multiple times, that this fellow was essentially thought to be a nut.}]

{I hid in the back seat of the car with the traffic cones as we drove home. There were police all around.}

[me: {You'll need to drive as un-suspiciously as you can. So please slow down.}]

{She was upset and continued to drive too quickly for my tastes. But we did make it back to a house.}

[me: {To make this run faster next time, I need you to prepare some 'Cliff's notes' explaining who Roy is so I can blend in a little better and not disrupt. Put those notes in one place, attached to a suitcase containing some decent clothes so that I can pretty much instantly get going. It would also help to have a photo or something so I know what I look like.}]

{As I was losing coherence, I began trying to go around the house and look at things...opening closets and seeing what was inside. I ran into a black cat in the hallway that I sort of recognized, and I stopped to pet it. It laid down and I was scratching it.}

[me: "I like you."]

[cat: ("telepathically") "I like you, too."]

[me: "What's your name?"]

[cat: "Polar Bear."]

[me: "That's not what they call you."]

[note {Somehow I knew the cat's owners had given it a different name.}]

{I left the building andgot into a car with some of my family members, where we engaged in a debate.}

[me: {What would happen if we drove to my apartment and looked in it? Will we see me there, asleep?}]

{Suddenly I was in some kind of interrogation room where these odd robots were trying to extract information from Roy. When I told them my real name, they shot me and I woke up.}
