{I was sitting on a couch with a girl I felt I recognized, and was looking at a graph of names. There were colored boxes. Arrows were connecting the boxes, and I understood it to be saying something about whether people liked each other or didn't know each other at all. The names would change a bit as I looked at them--e.g. from "joe" to "jon" (in a red box).}

[note [{From a distance, the graphic looked about like this:} [picture %imagesprocrastination20flowchart.jpg] "...though the labels on the boxes were white."]]

{One that stood out was that in an area that said "the media" there was a purple box that said "kojo" and that he had a YouTube channel...something about interviews and news.}

[me: {This looks familiar...this kojo. I've seen it before.}]

[note {There is a reasonably well-known [Kojo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kojo_Nnamdi) in the media, but he doesn't seem to have a YouTube channel.}]

[me: ("to girl") "What's your name?"]

[girl: "Something else."]

[me: "You can't remember?"]

{She mentioned that the last time she'd asked me about the name of an ex-girlfriend that I had just started talking about Windows. I told her the name of who she looked like, which caused her to come up to try and attack me. I fended off her hands, but a third hand somehow came up to choke me.}
