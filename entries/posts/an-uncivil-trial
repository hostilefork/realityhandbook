print {I was having a couple of dreams about women who are casual friends in real life asking if I wanted to go on dates doing certain activities. One asked if I would like to go play pool. Another asked if I'd like to go to an arcade.}

note "Neither are things I ever think to do, really."

print {I also found myself in a strange court trial, in which the accused was being physically tortured. The crime he was charged with is that he had claimed to be someone's father.}

note {I'm not sure if the insinuation was that the claim was biologically true but he was a bad parent, or if it was an issue of identity theft.}

dialog [

    judge: <to me> "What is your opinion?"

    me: {I don't know if he's guilty or not. But people should receive civil trials. In the world I am from this kind of torture is considered abominable.}

    judge: <to bailiff> "I have some paperwork for the policeman."

print {The policeman turned out to be me, and I was given the papers. Then I woke up.}
