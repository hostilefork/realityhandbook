print {I had been in a conversation with a woman and a man that was her husband/boyfriend, and she wanted to show me a ring she had gotten.  It had a pink stone that was kind of extruded from it.}

dialog [
    me: "Hmm, it's fairly extruded like that when it's set that way, I don't know why I wouldn't have noticed.  Maybe if you have a lot of other things on, I guess, a lot of accessories then things like that are less noticeable."

print << [
    {My point of view seemed to change to where I was seeing something that looked like a call stack on a computer, in black and white with numbers.  The conversation I was having became a bit cacophonous.}

    {My point of view moved into a situation where it was all dark and I couldn't really see anything, and I tried to give the ring back.  A woman responded.}
]

dialog [
    woman: "That's not my ring, it belonged to the other woman."

    me: "Oh, oops..."
]

print << [
    {I began to fret about something regarding objects being lost if you were in the midst of debugging something.  But I also didn't want to appear to not remember that person's name, so I tried to pull out my cell phone to look at it.}

    {There was an odd force when I went to open my eyes from the blackness and I felt like I was laying in bed but my body vibrated in a weird way.}
]

dialog [
    me: <muttering to self> "Uhhh, this feels really weird.  I wonder if any of this is actually dangerous?"
]

print {As I lay there a shadowy figure came up to me that I could somehow make out and he pinned me to the ground, and was going to poke something in my eyes and ears.  I panicked.}

dialog [
    me: "Hey, wait!  Don't hurt me!"

    man: "I'm not!"

    me: "Well, what are you doing then?"

    man: "It's an anaesthetic salt, to help get you recovered.  Anyway, we try to keep you out of trouble, because left to your own devices you can do a lot of damage."

    me: "I?  What do you mean when you say that?  What am I, the body or some...spirit, or, what do you mean to talk about 'me'?"

    man: "What does anyone mean.  But I'll make it simple: I'm in charge of watching over you, and covering for you.  So when you're talking to me, you're basically talking to God.  What were you *doing*, smashing in those windows?  There was a lot we had to explain.  You were on drugs, saying you had to 'rearrange sequences'."

    me: "I don't know anything about that.  I was just seeing darkness a moment ago, and then something that was like...a lot of conversations and something that looked like a computer stack, in black and white.  It had numbers in the cells, and I was talking to some people about losing a woman's ring..."

    man: "Hm.  Uh, what?"

print {Shortly after this a dog attacked me, and I had to recruit his help to fight the dog off...where he turned into a dog to fight it.  That fight was won, but then in trying to take the dog to throw him in another room there were other potential attacks, but I woke up before any of the other attacks.}
