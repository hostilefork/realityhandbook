[{I had picked up a piece of refuse, in which it was talking about a razor. The razor itself was missing, but the packaging was soft and textured... it felt a little oily. I tried reading the information aloud, as I walked past a crowd of people who seemed to be going about their business. Someone stopped to listen to me, and I confronted him.}]
[me: {I'm able to read when I'm awake. It's just difficult to read <i>here</i>.}]
[man: "Yes. You are one of about 100."]
[me: "One of about a hundred whats?"]
[man: "I don't want."]
[me: "Huh? I mean, what am I called?"]
[man: "Um."]
[me: {Look, quite simply, if I'm one of a hundred things of type X, <i>what is type X?</i>}]
[man: "Morphins."]
[me: "Okay, so I am a morphin. You are not a morphin?"]
[man: {No, no, there are thousands of us right here--at this moment.}]
[me: {Then you mean to say there are only 100 humans where I'm from, with, uh, 'morphin nature'?}]
[man: "Yes that is correct."]
[me: "Well, thank you."]
