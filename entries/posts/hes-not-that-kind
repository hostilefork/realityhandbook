[{I was in the bathroom of my apartment, trying to flush the toilet.  It started overflowing, and I opened the back of it.  It was verging on overflowing and the water was spiraling in a way that was unnatural enough that I clicked into lucidity.  As I did, a strange jade-colored structure start to raise out of the back of the toilet.  It had gold lines decorating it, and looked like kind of a squareish vase.}]
[{Keeping calm, I decided to see if I could mentally shape the vase and adjust its course as it rose; sort of like it was on a potters wheel.  Though I didn't touch it, I could mold it and move it as it rose.  It looked relatively cool and centered (for something that rose out of the back of the toilet.)  I held up my hand toward it.}]
[me: ("laughing") {All right, gimme five!}]
[{A somewhat skeletal hand which felt like jade and was matched to the coloring of the vase popped out and high-fived me.  I was startled, but regained composure.}]
[me: "Okay, then.  Hmmm... so if I can control things with my mind, can we do better than this?  How about an attractive girl instead of a... uh, toilet vase?"]
[{I turned the other direction and there was a short-haired woman wearing a skin-tight outfit.  It looked kind of like the costumes from Tron Legacy, except matching the jade and gold color scheme instead of black with blue or red lines.}]
[me: {Not bad, but I kind of like hair to be longer and straight.}]
[{The woman kind of morphed a bit so she had longer hair.  The rest stayed about the same.}]
[me: {That's closer.  But can you do other outfits, a bit more skin?  Let's say, how the girls are dressed in the Studio B "I see girls" music video, for instance?  Can you look things up on YouTube?}]
[woman: {I don't have access to your Internet--he's not that kind.  You'd have to show me.}]
[note {I'm not certain what the intonation of "he's not that kind" meant; as if someone wasn't giving her/it information because they weren't nice, or if this statement was meant to convey something about something not being the *sort* of entity that could or would provide such access.  Also I don't remember if I saw her mouth move in the communication, or if it was just "thought at me".}]
[me: "Well this place is acting like my apartment.  If we leave the bathroom, will the computers work?  What will come up in the browser?"]
[{The girl followed me out of the bathroom toward the bed, where a girl was asleep.  The girl in the bed remained asleep as I picked up my laptop and started it, but only got a few keystrokes in before I woke up next to the second girl.}]
[note {That one had been in the bed with me when I went to sleep, so that's not supernatural or anything.  The continuity of being in the dream is the weird bit in that case.}]
