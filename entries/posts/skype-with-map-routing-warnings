{There was a long period of dreaming where I was working with using Skype, and there was a tremendous amount of network map data. I was attempting to make a call. However, it was warning me of all these territories of network space that my call would be routed through that were presently blocked.}

[note 31-May-2008 {There's a nice <a href="http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/visual-tracert/">Visual Traceroute</a> tool which can show you how your packets are traveling through the internet. If you see it route your data through a hostile Iraq, you might worry...!)}]

{But unfazed by all the sketchy territories the tool was warning about, I kept pushing the "ok" button. It would pop up more warnings with more pictures of maps, so I couldn't get my call all the way through.}

{Eventually I noticed on another of my computer's screens that the mouse cursor had been taken over and someone was poking over the system at a superhuman rate. It was somewhat resemblant of how Frenzy (the small evil robot in Transformers) was hacking through data while on Air Force One.}

{Not feeling concerned that I had anything of value on that computer, I didn't stress out about it. But we were fighting over the mouse cursor...we both were controlling it. I sketched a motion of a letter "H" and then a letter "I", and the person seemed to get that I was friendly. He sort of stopped controlling the system a little bit and opened a notepad window for me to type in.}

[me: ("typed") "High hackr."]

{We had a dialogue that I don't really remember, though I recall he expressed puzzlement about what kind of crappy animation package was used to make the Microsoft Office assistant paperclip. He thought I might know for some reason.}
