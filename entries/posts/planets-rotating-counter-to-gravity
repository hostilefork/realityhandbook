{I was talking to someone about cities of the future.}

[man: {It's not safe to touch things with your bare hands. Ever.}]

[me: "Oh? What else is different?"]

[man: {It is legal to redesign your own genetics. But there is a mandatory 'randomization' factor, .1% of your DNA iss forcibly mutated in order to maintain diversity.}]

{This was happening on a street just a few blocks away from where I live today. There was a sign for an open mic night that read "Music nights are like parachutes".}

[note {This seems an obvious allusion to the joke "minds are like parachutes--they function best when open". Yet this is a twist by using it to describe an "open" mic. night. Given that I have to sit and figure out the joke, that makes it likely that the information is coming from outside of my head.}]

{I stepped in and a performer on stage addressed the audience.}

[performer: {I'd like to give a a shout-out to *Ike and Err*! That's right, who would have expected that this little TV program would have such a following and grow into a $150 million franchise?!?}]

[note {Though I can find no reference to "Ike and Err" on Google, it comes close to the "Ignignokt and Err"--the Mooninites from [Aqua Teen Hunger Force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_Teen_Hunger_Force).}]

{Hearing the performer's mention, I searched for "Ike and Err" in a database on some library's computer. It turned out to be the title of a children's book. Laboriously, I managed to write all the book's information (including its ISBN number) on a scrap of paper. When the information on the paper started oscillating, I picked up another piece of paper and started writing all the variations on that one.}

{Turning on a desk lamp to get a better view, I saw it make a circular illumination on the table. Suddenly surprised that a lamp would work so normally in a dream, I got up and walked over to the wall and found a light-switch. It bathed the room in a fluorescent light. Turning it off and then back on again, I marveled that it was functioning quite properly.}

[me: {And they say light-switches don't work in lucid dreams. Yeah, maybe not in *THEIR* dreams. Those people don't know what they're talking about.}]

{Finding a magnifying glass on the table, and imagined it might help reading the paper. I could read it more easily, but as I pulled the magnifying glass further away the numbers on the paper increased. When I pushed it closer to the page, the numbers got smaller. The authors also changed as I moved the magnifying glass.}

[note {The only author name I could remember upon waking up was "Burnin' Bambam".}]

{Two guys were now in the room next to me, listening to me exclaim about never hearing of any of these names.}

[guy-one: {Really? You haven't heard of Coronardo? It's one of the most famous streets in Nevada!}]

[me: {I'm trying to figure out the nature of my body here. Where is this? Who am I?}]

[guy-one: {Oh, they're going to kill him when they find out. The only way is with a knife to the skull.}]

[note {I had the impression that this guy was also an "alien inhabitor" of the body he was in.}]

[me: {What do you call our kind? I've taken to fancifully calling us 'the CIA', though obviously not the human CIA.}]

[guy-two: ("laughing") {Oh, I get it. Sort of a play on 'the CIA put a chip in my head!'}]

[guy-one: {Yeah that's funny, I guess, but couldn't you try a little harder to fit in?}]

{At that moment I realized that we were in some kind of diner. I was midway through dismantling the table top with some kind of tool, un-mounting it from its stand. When I finished unscrewing it the table top went flying and hit the ceiling. I got the attention of someone who seemed to be a waitress.}

[me: {Why did the table top go flying *up*? Shouldn't gravity have made it fall *down*?}]

[waitress: {The planet's rotation is 'gravity-opposite'. So that table top will be up there all night.}]

[me: ("to guy one") {What on earth does the direction a planet is rotating have to do with gravity? Isn't gravity based on mass?}]

[guy-one: {Yes. Gravity would work the same way no matter which way the planet was rotating.}]

[me: ("to waitress") {Do you have to buy some kind of apparatus to stop table tops from doing that? If so, who sells it?}]

"I woke up."
