print {A strange bathroom experience cued me into realizing I was dreaming. There was a young boy who helped guide me out of the bathroom and into a clearing.}

dialog [me: {Thanks for your help...now I need to get my bearings. My senses aren't reliable right now. Can you assist?}]

print {He tried to give me directions through a nearby building, but I asked to just be taken directly to who he wanted me to meet. Once we went inside, there was some odd set of rules in place in terms of who-could-go-where based on what kind of object you were carrying.}

dialog [boy: {In order to get through, you need to be carrying a gray drawer.}]

print {He tried to get me to pick up a gray plastic tub from a pile of multicolored tubs. A label on that tub identified the holder as being from some kind of newspaper.}

dialog [

    me: {I don't feel comfortable misrepresenting my credentials to get somewhere. Maybe you could carry it instead?}

    boy: "Nope, not me!"

    me: {Well, the last thing I need is a reputation as a liar. What should we do now?}

    boy: "You could talk to the data manager."

]

print {He pointed me toward an older German-looking man standing at the desk of a library, who was wearing a name card around his neck that said *DATA MANAGER*.}

dialog [

    me: <jokingly> "Hi. I'm some data, I need to be managed."

    manager: <amused> "If you are data, then where is your method?"

    me: "My method is perhaps lost in my madness."

]

note {This is a bit of a computer science joke, because in object-oriented programming an object has both data and functions called [methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_science)) which operate on that object.}

print {Because I got the impression that he was smart, I decided to abandon my quest to go elsewhere and just talk to him.}

dialog [

    me: {Have you heard of schizophrenia? Or lucid dreaming? Do you know what it means when I say 'I am asleep somewhere'? From my point of view, I entered your world moments ago and will wake up shortly in my own reality.}

    manager: {You are confused because you try to model that these things are happening in a simple sequence. You have a constructed idea of linear time, and it isn't *actually* working like that.}

    me: {Can you explain to me how time *actually* works then? It would be great if I could take some testable information back. Some kind of scientific breakthrough would be very helpful if I were to make it on the basis of talking to you.}

    manager: {That will be difficult to express in your... what you call... 'Facet Logic'.}

    me: <confused> "Facet logic?"

    manager: "Umm... I need to translate..."

]

print "His accent got heavier, and he paused."

dialog [manager: "The 'physics'?"]

note {I like the phrase "facet logic"--it appears some on pages about semantic web searches but no one defines it.}

print {Suddenly we were interrupted by a woman who came by.}

dialog [woman: <to him> {This facility is being inspected today. You shouldn't be chatting, you need to be attending to your duties.}]
