{I had a false awakening in the lobby of a building that seemed like a college dorm. A number of odd things happened, and all I could think about was that it was uncomfortable to be found sleeping undressed in a public area. I found some clothing, and a young man and I left the building to go into the green grass of the campus.}

[me: {Ok, I'm pretty sure we're in a non-physical state. Which is to say that we are merely projected here, because I do not remember driving or walking here from any previous place.}]

{He swiped his arm through my neck as if it would cut of my head, but it just passed through. I then began to notice objects floating through the air all around us. Some were geometric and others looked like variations of paper airplanes. They had a kind of familiarity...like I knew what these things were...they all had ads on them for websites.}

{Passing by a guy sitting cross-legged, I watched him blow a spherical bubble out of his mouth. It hovered around in the air. I tried making the same motion and a similar sphere appeared. I tried again and managed to make a sphere of a different color by "thinking it green".}

{I grabbed one of the floating boxes, and we flew along for a very brief distance before it shrunk down and plugged itself into a wall that seemed to be made up of a lot of loose jiggly flaps. Objects were coming and going from this wall. I pulled the flaps aside and saw that there was a grid of power plugs... as if it were some kind of recharging station that they were coming for.}

{The graphics jumped off the wall. Subgraphics took on their own life as well--as if a picture of a man holding a postcard would have the postcard jump off of it, and then a bird on the postcard would fly off of that into 3D space. Then the postcard would jump back into the man's hand, and the bird would return to its location.}

[me: "What IS all this?"]

[voice1: "Those are web-apps."]

[voice2: "No they are plugins!"]

{At this point the whole wall of flaps and objects rattled as if it were speaking itself.}

[wall: "They're LOADERS!!"]

[me: {Well you can't listen to the wall all day. Sometimes you have to make up your mind. There's writing on these objects and I'll read that.}]

{I pulled out one flap on the wall which became an object in my hand. It was a rectangular carton for a sport drink of some kind, with a foil part you tore off to make a spout.}

[note ["These cartons are called TetraPaks:" [picture %PdEAS-Myoplexready.jpg] {...and they are used for several different kinds of beverages.}]]

{There were some quotes on the package, said something about training, and all the various flavors of graphite-based drink you could get. You could get a third one free if you bought two in a special Craigslist offer. A coach grabbed my shoulder and startled me.}

[coach: {What are you doing? It's time to qualify for the race!}]

{He seemed mad, so I decided to play along rather than challenge him as to why I should be running a race. As I walked to the track I gulped down the drink in my hand, and was dallying a bit worrying about whether I should recycle it or if it would fly back to its place on the wall. The race had started so I just stuck it in my pocket.}

{When I ran, I managed to somehow "think myself ahead" on the track, and win despite starting late. I lost focus around here and woke up.}
