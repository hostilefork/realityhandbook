print {I'd had a long and somewhat personal lucid conversation from someone who was criticizing how I live my life. I apologized for not doing better, but since things seemed solid I shifted the conversation to dream mechanics. It seemed we were in a toy store with a lot of other people.}

dialog [

    me: "Okay, what about the attacks. What should I do?"

    guy: {Oh it's always monsters guarding treasures or something. I just disable that.}

    me: {You mean it's like a video game to you? Well I don't have any way to disable it. I won't last here very long if I don't get some help.}

print {At this point I seemed to become tangled in a thin green tape, and was being pulled at by a medium-sized green shrub.}

dialog [

    me: <panicked> {Here is a perfect example! Why is this shrub attacking me?}

    guy: <laughing> {I think you have it wrong, it's more like you're attacking it. Let's untangle you.}

print {I stopped struggling and he came over and began looking at the green tape. Some other people came over as well and started looking concerned.}

dialog [guy: {What the... no, you are right, this is going after you. It's not a shrub.}]

print {Someone in the crowd picked up the tree, it seemed to collapse down into a base and vanish. The base was a green plastic thing that looked something like a smoke detector (or maybe this thing that Google Images found called a "laundryball"):}

print {They dismantled the device and looked inside of it.}

dialog [guy: "It's using an emergency room code."]

note {The insinuation I got was that the tree was able to whisk me away from the dream situation somewhat like how an ambulance would be assumed to be helping--and not hurting--someone it was taking away.}
