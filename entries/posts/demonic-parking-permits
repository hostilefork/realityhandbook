{There had been several deaths at a swimming pool, and I somehow knew it had to do with the way it was constructed with a huge dropoff point that would trap you under ice. The best strategy was not to fight it, but to just relax and you would awaken somewhere else.}

{This happened to me, which led me to appear inside of a house. Two dogs had somehow managed to kill each other (simultaneously?) in a barn in the backyard, and I was pretty sure the police were going to come and question about it and the pool. A woman in plain clothes showed up, claiming some level of authority.}

[woman: {The responsibility for these deaths falls upon the ex-girlfriend of the person you've swapped houses with. She may look cute, but she's a murderer.}]

{Another solicitor poked in through the door, she was an old lady.}

[old-lady: {Just letting you know, the parking rules are changing. This is now a permit parking district, and those without a permit can only leave their cars for 2 minutes before they will be ticketed.}]

[me: {Those permits are outrageous, they cost $15 a month. I'll sooner park in another neighborhood and walk here.}]

[old-lady: ("angry") "These are the rules!"]

{I grabbed a halogen lamp and pointed it at her threateningly, yelling obscenities.}

[note {I don't know why I would do such a thing, nor do I know where I got the $15 figure from.}]

{I somehow managed to take the experience and turn it into a letter, and then dispose of the letter. When I threw it away there was a picture of the old lady smiling on it. While I was at the trash can, a man accosted me.}

[man: {I need your help, demons are after me. You've got to get me to a bus station!}]

{Relying on strange and possibly untrue information about where bus stations might be, I guided him outside and toward a shopping center, which had an Albertson's.}

[me: {If you're on the run, and you need food, you might want to stop in Albertson's. It's one of the cheaper grocery stores.}]

[man: "I know, I own it."]

{When he went into the store he went to the vegetables and started packing salad into bags. An employee thanked him.}

[employee: {Wow, you're bagging your own salad! Most people won't do that these days.}]

{The man also was trying to get a plastic cup that was sealed in plastic...someone provided him with one but they opened it as they gave it to him.}

[man: ("angry") "No, I need it *sealed*, that's the whole POINT!"]

[me: {The factory sealed condition was probably not perfectly hygienic in the first place. Now, I'm certain this is a dream, so I want to know more about what's going on. Do you have any particular knowledge that will help me?}]

[man: {One person you need to follow up on is Colonel Frasier. He was in attendance at your birth. Furthermore, be on the lookout: the demons are after you, [name], [name], and [name]}]

[note "This was a strange set of people that I know."]

[me: {Is there anything I can do in order to fight or counter the demons?}]

[man: "Contact Exadu."]

[me: "Can you spell that?"]

[man: "It starts with the letter X."]

[me: "Are you trying to say Xanadu?"]

[man: "Yes, that's it."]

[note {There are many different incarnations of Xanadu--Coleridge's poem, the Olivia Newton John movie, Ted Nelson's hypertext project...}]

[me: {The term refers to many things. What specifically do you mean? Please tell me quickly, because I'm going to wake up any second now.}]

[man: {Don't do it here in the store, hold out until you're on a bus...if you can.}]

{So I went outside and got on a bus, and walked to the back, where I saw someone who resembled a person I didn't know well...but had a natural dislike for as a bad character. When I greeted him, the world around me flashed red, and he attacked me.}
