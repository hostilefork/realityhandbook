print "I answered a phone."

dialog [

    phone: {You don't think she's just sitting there doing nothing, do you?}

    me: "Who?"

    phone: "Ann Candley"

    me: "Uh, can you spell that?"

    phone: {A-Y-N and Candley...with a C. As in I-Dream-of-Jeannie. There's a show very much like it in Britain.}

note {A search for British Genie sitcoms include [Genie in the House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_in_the_House) and [Pardon my Genie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon_My_Genie)...though they are children's shows and no one named Ayn is associated with it.}

dialog [me: {Okay, that doesn't make any sense. Really there's no point in trying to speak over mangled communication lines...do you have a better way of contacting me, perhaps email?}]
