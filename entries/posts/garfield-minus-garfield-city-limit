print {I'd been wandering around running crazy errands, but found myself in a kitchen and realized I was dreaming. Curious about what was in the cupboards and drawers, I started opening them. It was a lot of can openers and miscellaneous items... but I came across a phone book and decided to look at that. Opening it to the middle, I saw it had a section for "Denton".}

note {There are a fair number of places called [Denton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denton), apparently.}

print {As I turned the pages, the headings crossed into other things, like Devo. Puzzled, I went to the next room, where many people were seated.}

dialog [me: {Hey, how do you spell the name of the city we are in right now?}]

print {My question seemed to cause a bit of confusion. An Indian-looking man on the sofa answered me.}

dialog [

    man: "Dee. Eee. L. B. Eee. R. T."

    me: {Dilbert?! Why would you live in a city named Dilbert? Dilbert is a cartoon, about a nerdy engineer.}

]

print {I flipped to that page. The next thing I knew the scene blipped and I was standing at a table in front of two people. One was an older Asian man.}

dialog [

    me: {Okay, so... yeah, Dilbert, Devo... they're all being passed off as cities.}

    asian-man: "All right, got it."

    me: "So what happens now?"

    asian-man: "Well we're going to come out of the woodwork now."

    me: "Really?"

    asian-man: "No."

    me: {All right, I'm sick of these experiences. This is too...}

    asian-man: "Isolating?"

    me: {Yes, the weirdest... scariest... most interesting part of my life is so disconnected. And I just can't take it.}

print {Stomping off I was startled by a giant furry dog walking on its hind legs, or someone in a very convincing dog costume.}

dialog [

    dog: {C'mon. What's there to be afraid of. How many movies with talking dogs end up with anyone getting hurt?}

    me: "Reasonable point."

]

print {I ran into more people dressed in fur suits of some kind and a large, strange party.}
