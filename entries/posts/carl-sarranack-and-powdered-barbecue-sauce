print {I had a rare instance of being intentionally lascivious in a lucid dream. I was in a grocery store and summoning cute girls for sex acts. But at one point, this guy named Carl Sarranack objected to my behavior and demonstrated his disapproval by *throwing powdered barbecue sauce on my head*.}

note {There is at least one recipe on the web for [Powdered Barbecue Sauce](http://recipes.wikia.com/wiki/Powdered_Barbecue_Sauce).}

    {This was followed somewhat soon after by a false awakening. And I really, really thought I was awake--even though there was someone in my bed who shouldn't have been there. We were reading up on Carl Sarranack.}

    {One of the things we found was a Far Side cartoon making fun of him, captioned "Carl Sarranack has another idea...". It showed him looking at a clock and something else. I didn't get the joke, but apparently it played on the fact that he was the inventor of instant coffee, thus perhaps he was making something instant that obviously shouldn't be.}

note {In our branch of the multiverse the credit for inventing instant coffee goes to [Satori Kato](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_coffee).}
