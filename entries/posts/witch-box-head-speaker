{I found a friendly room of women up a staircase who were chatting about the fact that they read my website and were impressed.}

[me: "Can you enter my world the way I can enter yours?"]

[woman: {No. The inhabitants of your realm...they are supposed to be unhappy ALL of the time. They are not allowed to have dolls.}]

[me: {Well I bet it's possible! If you can show me how you read websites from my world, I can probably start to understand enough to give you information on how to send information back. I know a lot about tricks for encoding information across noisy channels, things like that...}]

{In response, the woman took off her face, it atrophied into something green that looked a bit like a Halloween witch.}

[me: <a bit repulsed> "Hey, ok, I can deal with that."]

{Then that face kind of dissolved and it degraded from being a face at all into some kind of box-shaped device, with a speaker. As the speaker of the box became disconnected...the room just turned to noise. I thought the dream was dissolving, but noticed the rest of the room was fine. The dream audio had just died.}

{Then the machine was reassembled to the point of being a box again, and the audio came back.}

[me: "Oh I get it! Wow, so you already HAD a bridge!"]

[voice: {No, but I have used mastery of technology to make one.}]

{At this point very tall woman--nearly twice my height--came and pulled me away from facing the box, into a bed with her.}

[me: "Are you who I was just talking to?"]

[her: "No. We should be resting right now."]

[me: "I want to talk to the box some more."]

[her: "They had to go handle an emergency at a pool."]

[note {It was one of those interpretation cases where it's hard to tell whether that was a joke, and they just decided to go swimming and call it a "pool emergency".}]
