{I was in bed with a girl in a dream, who resembled someone I know.}

[me: {All right. Now I need you to answer these questions as honestly as possible. They may sound silly, but I need your perspective.}]

[her: "Ok."]

[me: "What is my name?"]

[her: "Michael Jackson."]

[me: "What is your name?"]

{She said some nonsense words, which made me laugh a bit. I decided to ignore that.}

[me: "Nevermind. What year is it?"]

[her: ("confused") "29?"]

[me: {I'm used to year ranges that go something like four digits. To give you an example, my concept of the year is 2006.}]

[her: {Oh, you're not asking your age. You're asking the *date*.}]

[me: "Yes, the date."]

[her: "In our time most of the music has no name."]

[me: {Okay, that's pretty useless. But let me break this down for you the way I see it. Michael Jackson is a famous celebrity, once he was famous for being a great musician but now for being a child molester. That's not my name, and where I'm from I'm not famous at all. The thing you said for your name, didn't sound like a name at all to me. But you physically resemble someone I know.}]

[her: "I like you. Will you come back?"]

{My teeth started grinding and feeling painful, I spat a tooth out onto the ground.}

[me: {I can't really 'aim' in dreams, it's different all the time, and I better wake up soon because my teeth are falling out.}]

[her: {You could if you wanted to. But you probably can't wait to talk to her about the books and the songs.}]

[note "I don't know who the referenced 'her' was."]
