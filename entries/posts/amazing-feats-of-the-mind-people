{I was going down a street in my car when suddenly the car disappeared. Instead of a steering wheel, I was suddenlyholding some kind of bizarre cane that looked like a [telescopic antenna](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071213091009AAk8Iog) with a plastic knob for a handle that had a screen on it. The screen was saying something about an automatic shutdown due to the detection of drugs.}

[me: ("to girls nearby") {What is this device? What's it *for*? What drugs is it talking about?}]

{They didn't answer that, but they introduced themselves. One girl was named Charlie and the other was Jennifer Mc[something]. I followed them through a college-campus-like area, but just as I was beginning to truly realize it was a dream the scene changed. Suddenly I was on the floor of a room where a black man was standing next to a fireplace}

[me: "Argh, still not awake. Who are you? Where are we?"]

[black-man: "You don't need to worry."]

[me: {What's going to come of all this? Is anyone watching out for me?}]

[black-man: {You'll be taken care of. Ever since you took your first steps, we have known.}]

[me: "Known what?"]

[note {I wondered if 'first steps' pertained to walking or if it had a more general meaning of 'first phases'.}]

{I transitioned from being there into being in a kitchen in an ultramodern house. I somehow knew how to open a virtual door which made a portal to a pool patio at night. People were walking around but one girl in particular came toward me.}

[her: "REMEMBER: You're not actually *here*!"]

[note {I didn't know whether she meant for me to remember that I was asleep in a bed somewhere, or if the opening of the door out to the pool was some sort of illusion and I needed to remember I was actually in the kitchen. It also could have been some bigger nihilistic Zen statement.}]

[her: {We are not people of the flesh, we are 'mind people'... everything is possible here, except there can be no food.}]

[me: {How would it be the case that in a world of pure mentalism, where anything is possible, you can't have something as simple as food?}]

[her: "It has to do with the percentages of water vapor."]

[note {the phrase 'mind people' first appeared last August in [What do you Mean "We", Green Man?](http://realityhandbook.org/lucid-dream/what-do-you-mean-we-green-man/)}]
