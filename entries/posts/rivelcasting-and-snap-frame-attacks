print {I sort of phased into a dream mid-conversation, blurry and coming into focus, with a kind of jovial person who was seated with me in something built a bit like a restaurant booth, but it was seemingly in a house.}

dialog [
    man: {We were just going to cut our losses after an upgrade, were having a terrible time with Comcast and they weren't giving in with slipcasting attacks.  Didn't think there was anything there.  It was a fluke that we looked after a billing anomaly and found something--we found you!!}

    me: {Um.  Well Comcast is my ISP in Florida right now...  What's "slipcasting"?}

    man: {Hey.  Slipcasting, rivelcasting, snap-frame attacks...I could teach you about any of those all day.  I went to college just like anyone.  But still not as smart as you are, many would say.}
]

note {I didn't get the terms right, probably...but he was rattling off a bunch of kinds of "casting" attacks I do not know of and that's the closest I could remember.  An Internet search suggests "SubNetwork Access Protocol" is a term which might have some kind of technical 'frame' units in it to muck with, so maybe SNAP was something.}

dialog [
    man: {But I don't think that sitting around talking about tech is what you want, someone wants to see you.}
]

print {I felt a very skull-rattling knock on my head that hurt considerably.  It happened another time.}

dialog [
    me: <turning around> {Ow, what was that, something hit me...}
]

print {He pointed behind me at a sculpture of an owl that was sitting on the wall.}

dialog [
    man: <smiling> "Y'know, maybe it was the owl.  People around here like to play pranks...the owl likes to get in on the fun."
]

print {He paused and got more serious.}

dialog [
    man: {*Or*... maybe you hit your head right around near the time you died and you're getting some echoes of that.  Could be a sense from near-time of death.  Or could be a head punching owl.  Maybe neither, we might have rewritten parts of your brain on purpose just to confuse you...guess you're going to have to get used to not knowing.}
]

note {I had hit my head fairly seriously a few days prior to this dream.}

dialog [
    me: {If I'm to take it that I'm some sort of simulated being who has been having provable experiences of being pulled in various directions, why would I be the only one?  Wouldn't there have been others like me?}
]

print {An Asian-looking man walked up to us and handed me a book with a drab looking beige cover.  I tried to make out the title or any pictures on it but could not.}

dialog [
    asian-man: "Your *particular* kind of experiences...?  No, we don't know of anyone else quite like that.  But there are a lot of ways a life can be hard.  Here's a book written about a guy that you should read; I'd say he'd give you a run for your money."
]

print {We were still in transit on the way to meet someone who wanted to see me, and I passed a mirror in a hallway.  I looked about like I do currently.}

dialog [
    me: <disappointed> "So among requests I had if technological societies ever resurrected me from the dead--and I had to be a human again for some reason--was to look like I did when I was around late 20s and 30s.  I left pictures."

    man: <laughing> "Oh, no, no...balding heads are cheaper.  We found that particular one on discount--in fact, it wasn't even white at first.  We had to spray-paint it.  But now it's time to meet your friend."
]

print {A girl came up to me and kind of went to embrace me, though I sort of looked at her with unfamiliarity and she stopped and went to shake my hand.}

dialog [
    me: <suspiciously> "Yes, nice to see you.  It's been so long.  Good times, good times."

    man: "Don't be so skeptical, this is Tracy, she's a friend of Ellen's."
]

print {We went and met a girl who did look like a girlfriend of mine by that name, who was wearing jeans and a [Penny Arcade Tetris Heart T-Shirt](http://store.penny-arcade.com/products/pab070121), which she had during the era I knew her.  We embraced.}

dialog [
    me: "I see you still have the shirt."

    her: "Well there were enough pictures of it available to dig up, isn't ever hard to print another one when..."
]

print {She got emotional and was talking about how she thought she'd never see me again.  But the stories were about things that didn't happen...like me giving her a collection of little glass horses once, and how when she got mad at me she'd saved them to break one of them at a time.  And how she'd never told someone named "Jeff Mann" about me.  So I interrupted...}

dialog [
    me: "Well you look like the person I know, and that shirt looks like one she had.  But I'm sorry... I don't know who Jeff Mann is and I don't know of any glass horses.  So maybe there's some confusion here."

    her: "Let's go outside, I want to show you something."

print << [
    {We walked out of the house we were in and it was a sort of spacious outdoor area.  We went toward a small house that seemed to be on stilts, like a treehouse.  It had been painted colorfully, and there was a cardboard-like slide to climb to get up to it.}

    {She managed to get up the slide but when I did it sort of coiled down and I bumped onto the ground.  It had a tension in it like it would bounce up if I released it.}
]

dialog [
    her: <laughing about my fall> "Want me to kiss it and make it better."
]

print {I pointed the slide at her like it would release and she warned me to stop.}

dialog [
    her: <seriously> "You have to learn something and know it quickly.  This is not like a video game, its incarnate.  I can get hurt here, and I can feel pain."
]

print {I was about to ask more questions about the physics, but, inconveniently, awoke.}
