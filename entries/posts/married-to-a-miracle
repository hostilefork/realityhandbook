print {I was speaking with my mother and father in a room. They were showing me some books. Neither seemed like themselves, and spoke with very different voices.}

note {For a time my focus was on the books and I was trying to remember the titles, but my attention shifted and I no longer remember them.}

dialog [

    mother: "We've been asked to evaluate your situation."

    me: {Well this is a situation that needs evaluating.  Tell me, am I... am I usually here asleep or something, or what? What will happen to me here when I wake up?}

    mother: {Usually you vanish while you're in the system.  There have only been a few people who have been miracles, sometimes you get married to one and only find out later.}

note {I could not tell from this context if what I do makes me a 'miracle', or if being one would require the ability to NOT vanish while dreaming. This was a little jumbly. The term marriage has been used before to describe a partnership between a spirit and a body.}

dialog [

    me: "Look, enough gibberish.  What is going on?  I want answers!"

    mother: "Don't go with the anger."
