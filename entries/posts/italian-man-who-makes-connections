{I was at some kind of strange outdoor event before dawn, where people were walking along in a line. I was given two entrance tickets. Then a man handing them out pulled me back and handed me another one. Looking closely at the tickets I saw they had drink vouchers on them.}

[me: <to self> {A-ha, so that's how the free beer is supposed to work. Only *one* is free. Well I guess they're giving out extra vouchers if you get here early.}]

{We approached a park area, with a lot of asphalt and a little bit of playground equipment. There was a stack of speakers and amplifiers as if a band were going to play later. Some people looking at the skyline began a countdown. Fireworks went off when they were down to about 5. But they kept counting.}

[me: <joking> {If you were counting down the moment the fireworks were going to start, I think you can stop counting once they do...and just accept you were off.}]

{For some reason I knew I was going to be driving fairly soon. I had been staying at the apartment of some guy who was also at this event, but he was leaving town right after. So I was wavering on whether I should enjoy 3 beers and then have to drive or not.}

{The beers were in clear plastic cups and already poured. A bartender at a table was chatting about the prices they'd gotten.}

[bartender: {We got a great deal on beer for this event. Each beer was 90 cents instead of the usual 99.}]

{My friend who I'd been staying with was telling someone about his upcoming trip.}

[friend: {So yeah, I'm going to China, and this is going to be my first time on a megasonic jet. They're like 1000 miles per hour. I'm scared.}]

[me: <interrupting> {They ramp up to that speed and then back down, I doubt you'll notice any difference. You don't feel velocity, just acceleration.}]

[friend: "It's just the principle of it, y'know. Too fast."]

{Time passed and things began to wrap up. I walked into a sort of bakery/diner that I deduced was connected with the event, maybe providing some of the food. At first I was going to say goodbye, but I saw a girl inside that I recognized who I wanted to talk to.}

[me: {Hey, long time no see. And now this... of course is a dream. So I've not seen you even now.}]

[her: <in strange accent> {What is point with what you are saying? Is that we are 'not actually here'?}]

[me: {There's matters of degree, but your question is pretty metaphysical. Is one actually anywhere, ever?}]

[her: {Yes--absolutely yes! The connections between us are so real, we are wrapped in a bubble or superstring or what it is you want to call them. You don't even have to imagine this connection, you can see and feel them.}]

{She raised a hand to her head, and somehow it seemed to pull on something on the side of my head. In the moment, I started to think of the artwork of Alex Grey:}

[her: {You felt that, right? These are connections. He makes them.}]

[me: "Who is he?"]

[her: {The attractive Italian man. CompProwSec! All the connection comes from him.}]

[note {That's not precisely what she said. But was something that sounded like a mispronunciation of some kind of computer product. I got the feeling she was mistaking an automated system [like a email server, or anti-virus software] for an actual person.}]
