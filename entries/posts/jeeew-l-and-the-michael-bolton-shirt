{Circumstance was that I became aware I was dreaming, grabbed controls of some helicopter-like device, and flew around in it. There was an overhead control and a wheel to the left and right. Having only two hands I grabbed the left control and the overhead one, leaving the right one alone...but I was panicking because I didn't really know what these controls would do. Somehow I kept the helicopter from crashing, though I could sense or hear people on the ground calling for help...as if I was flying a police helicopter or something and they thought I would be able to help them.}

{I aimed for a spot on the ground, landed, and the helicopter folded itself up into some kind of backpack. I went to put it on and walk off, but was stopped by a man at a desk who insisted I needed to sign in for having landed. Still knowing I was dreaming, I tried to interact with the sign-in computer, but had no idea what information it was asking me for. I surrendered and presented myself to the people at the desk, telling them I was asleep in a bed in Austin and it was 2012 and I really had no f'in clue what was going on.}

{As soon as I did so, they seemed to prepare weapons to attack me.}

[man: "Oh, look we what we have here...a REAL EUGENE."]

{I waved my hands and pleaded and said "I don't know what you think about what is true or not true about me, or what you've been told, I just haven't been told anything, please believe me. I'll hear you out, you can hear me out, but I'm not doing anything threatening. Let's just talk, okay?"}

{They seemed to ease up and a crowd started to gather around me, to protect me from them. One was an Asian girl wearing a white dress with moire patterns on it and some primary colored symbols I recognized. I went to her and said:}

[me: {I know this pattern, and this material. You are from Google. Help me!!!}]

[note {I now realize in retrospect that the pattern I recognized was from the headband in the video ["Light Outside"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okAQ-aRTBAY), by a band perhaps appropriately named "Wakey, Wakey"}]

[asian-girl: {Yes, I'm a fan of Google... but... you know who else I like?}]

"She paused and looked at me intently."

[asian-girl: "Michael Bolton."]

{People around us looked completely perplexed. I struggled in my semi-conscious state to respond, and remember why Michael Bolton was cool...it took me a little time, but I remembered the Saturday Night Live music video [Captain Jack Sparrow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Sparrow_(song)):}

[me: {Yes! Michael Bolton is great...because...of Captain Jack Sparrow!}]

{She seemed happy that I'd mentioned it, the audience looked perplexed at the two of us. Trying to go further, I sang a line of the song:}

[me: ("singing") "This is the tale... of Captain Jack Sparrow..."]

[note [{So goes the typical weird dream, but this had a followup in waking life. A friend of mine had a birthday the next day, and he was wearing an all white T-shirt with a square picture that appeared to be the cover from a Michael Bolton album. He said...and I didn't challenge...that he was once a drummer, and that the reason he had the shirt is that he'd been commissioned to play drums in Michael Bolton's band, in his post-fame era. So I recounted the dream above to him.} {He was surprised and thought that was an interesting coincidence. Suddenly out of nowhere he just makes this weird noise and goes: "JoooooooL!"} {When I asked him what he had just said, he replied by saying: "I don't know. Sometimes I make weird noises, involuntarily. That was kind of an odd one, wasn't it? It's like I was started saying 'Jew' but I ended it with an L... like I was saying 'Jewel'."} {This particular friend has no background in reading my journal, or the odd experiences I've had in the past with [appearances of folks singer Jewel](http://realityhandbook.org/misc/1020-jewel-0304/)...a musician I don't particularly follow.}]]
