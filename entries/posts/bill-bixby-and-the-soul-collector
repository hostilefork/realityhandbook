{I was somehow climbing a ladder for the purposes of a play that involved Peanuts characters.}

[someone: "This play you've written is so excellent!"]

[me: "Oh, I didn't write it. Bill Bixby did."]

[note {I had no idea who [Bill Bixby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Bixby) was prior to looking it up after this dream.}]

{Coming down from the ladder, there was an interviewer, some producer, and Steve Martin.}

[producer: {We're going to make a lot of money tonight on ticket sales!}]

[steve-martin: "Well, you deserve success, it's great work."]

[interviewer: "Would it be okay if I quoted you on that?"]

[steve-martin: "That would be fine."]

[interviewer: <to me> {Can you tell me about your involvement with the production?}]

{At this point I became lucid, and started asking questions about the environment. Yet as I walked around the stage all the people were disappearing. There was only me and a fairy-like woman left.}

[me: "Where did everyone go?"]

[fairy: {I turned them all into souls and collected them, I found ten so far.}]

[me: "Why didn't you turn me into a soul?"]

[fairy: "Because they were all dried out. You aren't."]

[me: "Who are you?"]

[fairy: "I've come from the Ivory Coast."]
