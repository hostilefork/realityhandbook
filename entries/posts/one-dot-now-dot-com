    {I was meeting up with some people at a kind of outdoor street fair at night.  There were a lot of different tents or areas roped off.}

    {One of the newsworthy goings-on at this event was that you could get something called "onepork".  I'm not sure what was so special about it, but only a couple of the vendors had it.}

    {We went into one that seemed to have an entire pig roasted and cut up.  (So if "onepork" was a vegetarian synthetic product, they were going rather extreme with the simulation.)  I noticed that the entire pig seemed to have sauce and seasoning on it.}

    {The vendor gave me a sample, and struck up a conversation.}

dialog [
    vendor: "How do you like it?"

    me: "It's...pretty good I suppose.  It might be a better idea though if the entire pig weren't pre-seasoned, and you let people sort of self-determine how much sauce and stuff they'd add."

    vendor: "That's not a bad idea.  Hey, I think I've seen you...which hotel are you staying at?"
]

print {We discovered we actually were staying at the same hotel.}

dialog [
    vendor: "Well I don't really know the area here, I just came for the demo.  If you guys want to hang out later, let me know--here's my card."

print {He gave me one of the most unusual business cards I've ever seen.  I kind of marveled at it, flipping it around.  I noticed specifically that his web address was listed as `one.now.com`.}

note {At time of writing, `now.com` looks up in my world to a Chinese language news site.}
