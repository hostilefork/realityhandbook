{I was playing with some wooden blocks that would stick together like LEGOs. They didn't plug into each other in any way, they were adhering through something more like magnetism.}

{A guy was narrating how they worked and describing how to create a duplicate of a group of blocks you had made. This sounded like an interesting feature so I was trying to follow the instructions. But they were referring to menu options.}

[me: "Wait. I don't see a menu on mine."]

[guy: "You have to turn it on first."]

{I noticed that the base block onto which I was building had an ON button and I pushed it. A dotted glowing yellow box hovered in front of my field of vision--like a viewfinder in a camera. Some writing and objects materialized in front of me, on a solid translucent wall. The wall was very exciting to me for some reason.}

[me: "Is it possible to...break that wall?"]

[guy: ("laughing") "Probably, I guess."]

[me: "What would the pieces be like?"]

[guy: "Millions of virtual shards!"]
