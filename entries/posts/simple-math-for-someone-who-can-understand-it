{While using my computer outdoors, there was an unusual email on my laptop, addressed to me. It had a subject line with symbols in it--something like "•*"*•&#9733;•*"*•simple math•*"*•&#9829;•*"*•for someone who can understand it•*"*•&#9733;•*"*•". When I opened the message, it was running an animation in the title bar.}

[note [{The animation looked like Conway's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a>:} [picture %GoL4.gif] {...which is commonly studied by computer scientists.}]]

{I assumed there was some kind of web browser vulnerability going on. Looking to see if I was running Internet Explorer, I saw that I was running Firefox. Whatever was going on was making the browser hang, so I went to kill it. But I was interrupted by a guy who came by.}

[guy: "You have to get home now, this isn't a safe place."]

[me: {I don't know if you're trying to distract me from my dream investigation or trying to help me. But I'll tell you what...if you tell me a funny joke, I'll listen to your advice.}]

{He started into a joke that didn't seem very funny, but while he was doing so everyone started clearing the area as if something dangerous was about to happen. I decided to make a run for it, but fell on the sidewalk. A horse trotted up to me and licked my hand, which woke me up.}
