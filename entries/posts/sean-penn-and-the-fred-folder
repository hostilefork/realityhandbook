    {I felt I'd woken up from a dream, seemingly near the hallway to my apartment. I wasn't sure I was awake, but it looked very stable. I was wearing only a shirt and nothing on my lower body.}

    {Walking into my apartment, I saw my roommate and several other people I know were in the kitchen talking. It was a party atmosphere and I was uncomfortable about my state of undress, but *reasonably* confident that it was a dream. Yet everything looked right, things were solid, and nothing seemed awry. When I got to my room and turned on the computer, however, the screen was some odd operating system I'd never seen before.}

    {On the screen was an alert message about wanting to play a media file, but had to download a patch. Though the OS was odd and graphical, it flipped into a text mode to do this patch and gave me a box for entering a password. I debated entering my machine password but decided not to... so I just hit "Enter" in the password slot. This caused it to pop up a box saying that I had several choices for how the program would react, one of which was just to stop.}

    {Some people came in, one of whom looked a bit like a younger Sean Penn. They watched as I picked items up and tapped on them, like the rumpled sheets on my bed or the guitar in its case.}

dialog [me: {I don't get it. How can a dream be made such a precisely real recreation of my room... except with a different computer operating system? These objects are all solid.}]

print {The guy who looked like Sean Penn grabbed me and sort of swayed me back and forth.}

dialog [young-man: {You mean like this? Sure, anything's possible... solidity, fluidity. These objects are here because there are *agreements*. We agree for them to be here, and so they are.}]

print {Some colored folders began appearing on the bed... bright red, yellow, blue, and green. It looked like the red folders had labels. From a distance I could read a covered "FR" on one of the reds.}

dialog [

    me: "Does that folder say 'FRIEND'?"

    young-man: "No, it says FRED."

]

print {I picked up the Fred folder and flipped it open. It contained a dense packet of photocopied black and white pages that had been bound or stapled together. He looked amusedly at the pile.}

dialog [young-man: {Well, this is one way of getting things done, I guess. Very...physical. But hey, it might be the right way to do it in some case.}]

print {He and the people in the room were suddenly covered in colored square post-its. I still had the idea stuck in my head that the colors had something to do with who was a friendly or hostile force. But each person was covered with a lot of different colored post-its, not just one. The colors were very pure red, yellow, green, and blue.}
