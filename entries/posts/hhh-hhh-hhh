{I saw some odd things, music videos which had clock faces doing strange things. One had the shorter hand moving faster than the longer hand. At one point the perspective of the clock tilted, and it a had a very geometric spider-like creature on it.}

{A little bothered by the proximity of the large spider thing, I tried to change my perspective. I couldn't turn my head and see anything but blackness. My whole field of view sort of disappeared, and I ended up just reaching around until I picked up a small rectangular object, which I began to feel with my hands.}

{As I felt the object, I noticed it had what felt like a seam, as if it were wrapped. I tore off the wrapping paper and somehow my vision came back; I was standing next to a car. The object turned out to be a book, and I flipped through it but didn't know quite what to do with it. So I opened the back door of the car, put the book inside, and then locked the door and shut it.}

{A woman was putting some objects in the trunk and wearing what looked like a very simplified and streamlined space suit. I approached her kind of aggressively, but then backed off when she seemed seemed puzzled by my behavior.}

"I told her my name."

[her: {Wow. I knew you were from Earth, but I never knew that was your name.}]

[me: "What is your name?"]

[her: "Brin Williams."]

[me: "What would you call this planet?"]

{She looked confused. I pointed sort of furiously down at the ground.}

[her: {As you would call the place which you are familiar with 'Earth', we call this Tsiu Tsiu Tsiu.}]

[me: "Oh? How would you spell that?"]

{She smiled, as if she knew what she was about to say wasn't going to mean anything to me.}

[her: "H-H-H. H-H-H. H-H-H."]

[me: ("sigh") {Well I can remember that, but I don't think I'll be seeing it referenced anywhere else.}]

[her: {You're not going to be able to see much here, I'm afraid.}]

[me: {Why not? Is it not going to look like much to me because there's more here that I'm not able to sense, or because there just isn't a lot here?}]

[her: {No, they just haven't found a site to build on yet.}]
