{I was trying to get my bearings. There were many bald men around me wearing drab clothes in an institutional environment.}

[note 6-Jun-2008 [

        {Reviewing this old dream, I realize that the environment was dark, perhaps like the prison colony Alien 3...}

        {...but in feeling, it was rather similar to THX 1138 in terms of brainwashing and regimentation...}

        "...in any case, a bunch of trapped bald guys."

{I decided to try asking people their names. One fellow approached me and pointed to his nametag, as if it were very important. It said "Naugai."}

[me: "Hmmm. Is that pronounced Noo-guy?"]

[naugai: <quiet but earnestly> "No. NAWTGAY."]

{As I understood it, whatever circumstance he was in necessitated sending the message that he wasn't homosexual in code. The scene transitioned quickly to where I was looking at a newly arrived email in my inbox, and thought I'd woken up. The message was from a Russian online gaming service.}

[note {The service had the word "Tap" in it, like [GameTap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gametap), but I believe it was something else.}]

{The content of the message was a special advertisement, and said that said you would get a special point bonus if you played *Waking Life 2* as the character Naugai.}

[note {I was temporarily excited because I thought I had woken up and this a direct dream verification. Then I realized I wasn't completely awake yet.}]

[update [

        {I just noticed that the name noogai3 is used in a fairly famous cartoon about a flash animated character breaking out of the "Matrix" of his world:}
