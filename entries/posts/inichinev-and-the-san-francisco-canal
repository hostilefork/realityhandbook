{Was in a fight with someone and agreed to step off if she did. She did agree, so we moved away from each other.}

[me: {I feel like I don't trust you because you seem to be more adept at this realm. Why is this? What are you in real life?}]

[her: {My journal user name is the name of my favorite canal in San Francisco. Do you know who Inichinev is?}]

[me: {Can you tell me anything about when you live? I'm from 2007. What time are you from?}]

[her: {We just got a big message about a new constitution. It's very inspiring, and has poems in it as well.}]
