[{I was flipping through some movies, because I was trying to select a film for some purpose. When I could not find it, I began describing the film I was looking for to someone in the room.}]
[him: "Is this a new story?"]
[me: {No, it's a very common one... the idea that believing in something makes it real... thought incarnates into a form. Buddhist thing. Kind of like how we are incarnated now.}]
[{Had I been less groggy, I might have said <i>Velveteen Rabbit</i>. I noticed I was dreaming and began describing what he looked like. He vaguely resembled the level of computer-generated avatar design that was in the Dire Straits <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=x8Qvv3RdW-Q">money for nothing</a> video.}]
[me: {You look like you have purple hair, almost in the shape of a helmet. And you don't have feet, your legs end in rounded nubs. What do I look like?}]
[him: "Why don't you look in a mirror?"]
[me: "I'm afraid it might make me wake up faster."]
[him: "Don't worry about that."]
[{I was kind of stocky also, with a kind of computer-animation five-o-clock shadow. I was wearing blue denim, and the collar of the shirt I had on was some kind of lopsided buckle. I took off the shirt and saw I was wearing a black cape underneath that. There was only one mirror, so I looked at another wall and a second mirror materialized. I confirmed that I looked the same.}]
[him: "I'm gonna charge you extra for that second mirror."]
["I responded with a confused look."]
[him: {No, no! I'm just making a joke. I like that you looked in more than one. It's good thinking.}]
