{I was sitting on some kind of ledge with a towel wrapped around my waist, outside of some small building in a large field. It was a showering area, and the door to the showering area was propped open. While noticing how hard it was to balance on the ledge and keep my body covered, it made me lucid and I called out to those around me.}

[me: {You guys, I'm in bed right now. Do you know what that means?}]

[muscular-guy: ("laughing") "IN BED!!"]

{He jumped up as if he were going to knock me off of the bar I was resting upon, but I managed to stay perched.}

[me: "Please don't do that, it would hurt if I fell."]

[random-guy: {Yeah, the rocks are pretty rough, he'd need help if he fell.}]

[me: {Look, I'm going to repeat my question. Do you guys remember waking up this morning?}]

[random-guy: "Of course."]

[me: {Okay, do you remember what you had for lunch yesterday?}]

{There was no answer, they were just kind of silent. One of the guys sort of morphed into an opened tin can of beans.}

[note {I didn't think of this at the time, but looking back it could have been a way of communicating an answer with a visual manifestation.}]

[me: "How about your name. Do you know your name?"]

"Once again there was silence."

[me: {Doesn't it bother you that you don't know your name? I'm not making fun of you. I'm just trying to point out that something doesn't add up about this place.}]

[someone: {Not having a name doesn't bother me. What bothers me is that they suppressed me.}]

[me: "Who suppressed you?"]

[someone: ("pointing to the sky") {The ones in the office. From the nebulae Cumina Cumir Formis.}]

[me: "Can you spell that?"]

[note {He gave me the spelling which I approximated above. "formis" means ant in Latin. "cumir" means compact or concise in Gaelic. Cumina is a word that is somewhat popular in location names and even a religion, mostly relating to notions of hollowness or the spice cumin.}]

{People started paying more attention to the sky, and they were getting nervous. I saw some kind of transparent blue dot approaching, and I decided to lay on my back and watch it get bigger. Sensing that I would wake up when it reached the ground, I just flipped it the bird as it approached.}
