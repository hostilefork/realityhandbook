{I wound up in a warehouse area that had piles of packaged food and items, including [Greens+ bars](http://www.greensplus.com/product_info.php/products_id/47). There was a girl with me who was picking up items. I decided to eat one of the bars.}

{Looking on the box I noticed a white sticker that said simply "40".}

[me: {Do these things cost money, or is this a free-for-all?}]

[her: {They don't cost anything, as long as you keep it under 40. But be quiet about it being free, because the night farmers are out.}]

{We started walking outside and the settings were very beautiful and movie-like. I wondered if it would be possible to capture an image of it and then transmit it to the waking world. Also, I became curious if such technologies were possible if they'd already been used somehow.}

{Suddenly a book popped into my field of view, with a message from "The Tooth Fairy". It seemed like she was some kind of Office Assistant.}

[tooth-fairy: {Yes, indeed, they have made movies here and transmitted them to your world. But do you expect some sort of reward for crossing the boundary?}]

[me: "Reward?"]

[tooth-fairy: {I had expectations of a reward when I first crossed the boundary at 23, but none came. My name is Erin.}]

{Our conversation was interrupted and I was threatened by a large woman who seemed like some kind of archetypal evil Queen. She attacked me and I woke up.}
