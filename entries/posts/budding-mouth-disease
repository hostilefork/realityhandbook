    {I was dancing around in front of a mirror, and I was kissing a girl. Then a guy came over and pointed out a small flower-bud-like object on the corner of my mouth. The girl ran away in terror.}

    {When I picked the bud off, but then more of them started growing inside my mouth. I'd spit them out, but they grew larger and larger.}

dialog [

    me: "What are these things?"

    guy: "There's no cure. You'll be dying soon."

    me: "So what should I do?"

    guy: {Find the biggest brown thing you can and latch onto it, and be reborn next spring.}

note {At the time, I thought the big brown thing he was alluding to would be a tree.}
