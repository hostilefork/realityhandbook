[{I heard a phone ringing. It was a little difficult to find, and on a very messy desk...I was clued in that I was dreaming because of the abstractness of the scene. But I answered it anyway.}]
[me: "Hello, who's this?"]
[voice: "Social services."]
[me: "And who are you looking to be speaking to?"]
[voice: "We're looking for Michael (last name garbled)."]
[me: {I'm not sure where he is, or if you mean me, or what.}]
[voice: "Come on. Will you just buzz us in?"]
[me: {My capabilities are limited at the moment. I'll push all the buttons on the phone, but that's about all I can do.}]
["So I pushed the buttons and woke up."]
