{While browsing my user profile on Wikipedia, I noticed that this rather strange phrase was entered in the middle of it:}

[quote {I much prefer a cuckolding to a cod-stepper was vandalously edited into one of my webpages.}]

[note {Though it's not a word used much in the modern vernacular, I do know that "cuckolding" to refer to the idea of a man who is cheated upon or otherwise humiliated in a relationship.}]

{Even though I couldn't entirely understand it, I took this as an insult. Unfamiliar with the phrase "cod-stepper"--and still in the dream--I attempted to look it up in the dictionary. There was a result, and it was something like this:}

[quote {cod-stepper - noun - an unwise or unsound business proposition (Ex: "I invested $20,000 in electronic bagels. What a cod-stepper that was!")}]

"After doing a few more searches I awoke."

[note {There's no definition for cod-stepper, but each component is a word. A <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=stepper">'stepper'</a> is a term for a professional and/or fast dancer. And <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=cod">'cod'</a> refers to the fish, the cape in Massachusetts, and "Cash On Delivery"). Cod is also an archaic slang term for testicles...and a synonym for the verb for "fool" or hoax.}]
