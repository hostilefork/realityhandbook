{I was in a building, trying to find the exit. It was something like a garage. Eventually I found a man sleeping on the floor and asked him if there was a way out.}

[man: {The only way out is in the front where the concierge is. But you'll get Tazered if you tried to leave.}]

{Basically we were trapped in a complex where the oppressive leadership had sealed the people inside off from the outside world. I started questioning him about how many beings were trapped there, and eventually the scene melted into a badly-photoshopped-together video about how a murderer had been killed in an elaborate 10-minute chase. It was clearly a fake (to me).}
