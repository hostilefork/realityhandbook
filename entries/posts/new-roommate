print "Talking to a friend in a dream."

dialog [

    me: {Come on tell me something here in the dream that people don't know, a secret--some kind of proof!}

    him: {We can only communicate in established points of view.}

    me: {Oh please, think! Just something you haven't told me and I'm unlikely to know. I'm not interested in convincing the world, it only has to convince *you*.}

    him: "I can't think of anything."

print {I kept begging and trying not to wake myself up. But at some point he had faded out and turned into an good-looking and heavily tattooed girl.}

dialog [me: {I'm sorry, you're very attractive. But I was working on something. Can I speak to my friend again?}]

print "He re-appeared in another part of the room."

dialog [

    me: {It doesn't have to be profound. Just say some stuff that comes to mind.}

    him: "Crown Royal."

    me: "The drink? A story about a drink?"

    him: {No, you know, the name of your... the name of your thermos, um, no... the, something you go by. Handle. Room alias!}

    me: {Oh. You're trying to tell me one of yours? Yours was?}

    him: "New Roommate!"

note {Crown Royal or a new roommate was not relevant to the friend in question when I asked.}
