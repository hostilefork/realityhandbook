"Talking to a friend in a dream."

[me: {Come on tell me something here in the dream that people don't know, a secret--some kind of proof!}]

[him: {We can only communicate in established points of view.}]

[me: {Oh please, think! Just something you haven't told me and I'm unlikely to know. I'm not interested in convincing the world, it only has to convince <i>you</i>.}]

[him: "I can't think of anything."]

{I kept begging and trying not to wake myself up. But at some point he had faded out and turned into an good-looking and heavily tattooed girl.}

[me: {I'm sorry, you're very attractive. But I was working on something. Can I speak to my friend again?}]

"He re-appeared in another part of the room."

[me: {It doesn't have to be profound. Just say some stuff that comes to mind.}]

[him: "Crown Royal."]

[me: "The drink? A story about a drink?"]

[him: {No, you know, the name of your... the name of your thermos, um, no... the, something you go by. Handle. Room alias!}]

[me: {Oh. You're trying to tell me one of yours? Yours was?}]

[him: "New Roommate!"]

[note {Crown Royal or a new roommate was not relevant to the friend in question when I asked.}]
