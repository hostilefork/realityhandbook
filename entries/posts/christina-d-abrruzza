    {This morning I was reading an email thread from someone named "Christina D'Abruzza". I managed to somehow drill down into the address book entry and read her email address, but I forgot it.}

    {The computer I was using looked like it was running Mac OS/X and it said something about being "Kiti's Computer".}
