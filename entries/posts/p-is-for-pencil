print {I was becoming frustrated at communications with a group during a dream.}

dialog [me: {I don't understand why we can't communicate, because you must speak English. Some of you must, anyway.}]

print "I located a pencil and held it up."

dialog [me: "What is this object called?"]

print {They stared at me blankly. I hummed the Sesame Street song "C is for cookie".}

dialog [

    me: "You know the song? What is it called?"

    kid: "C is for cookie."

    me: {Okay, now let's play another game. *BLANK* is for pencil...}

]

print {Someone in the room picked up the pencil and shouted.}

dialog [

    person: "P!"

    me: {Right! Okay, put that down. Now I need more objects...}

]

print {I got lost and had to restart. I found a different group, and addressed a girl with a pencil again.}

dialog [

    me: "What is the first letter for this object?"

    girl: "Five?"

    me: "No, no, try again."

]

print {Someone else piped in with "four?" which made me begin to speculate.}

dialog [me: {These are... numbers... are you thinking in ASCII? Wait, that would be too low, even for the first digit. Unless... unless maybe in hex? Do you know the ASCII code?}]

note {Pencil in ASCII hex is actually 50454e43494c. So someone looking at hex digits might say the first "letter" is 5, though that's quite a stretch.}

dialog [

    girl: {Have you ever considered taking like... a nervous break?}

    me: {You mean a break from thinking all the time? I think I need one.}

print {An awakening led me to become paralyzed in a room I could see I had the body of a deformed fish, that looked like it had been in an accident. People were talking to me, saying "Jeremy, wake up."}
