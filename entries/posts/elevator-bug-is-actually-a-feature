{I had several dreams, they were taking place in some kind of restaurant in a mall, and would end in an attack. The dreams would start on the first floor of the building where there was an elevator. A woman would send a man into the elevator and then down a floor, using some controls to time how long doing so before bringing it back up.}

[me: "Wait a second. What are you doing?"]

[elevator-operator: "It's a timing issue, very specific."]

[me: {What benefit do you get by going down a floor and then coming up at a specific time? Are you exploiting a bug?}]

[elevator-operator: {I don't know if I'd say that. Elevators are a system, systems have properties.}]

[me: ("sigh") {Are you saying --It's not a bug, its a feature--? I've known programmers like you.}]

[man: {She didn't want to give root access to the elevator console, but had to. It was an order from higher up.}]

{I went to the main floor of the restaurant, there was a fair amount of confusing stuff going on. Trying to defend myself from attacks, I asked someone about it while poking him.}

[me: "What is with these attacks?"]

[girl: "Oh, you mean like this?"]

{She caused some kind of piercing pain in my groin, and I didn't see quite how.}

[me: "Yes, exactly!"]

{By now I'd come upon some people at a window that looked very much like a receptionist desk at a cheap medical clinic--lots of files, a rotary phone, and a woman sitting behind a desk. There were piles of thick blue hardcover books in front of her, which were volumes of something called 'Sara on Art', it was hard to get a fix on.}

[woman: {You're the closest path I have to my women, so when I want to make an edit to one of them, I say 'hey, rip this guy out'.}]

[me: ("angry") {Oh yeah? Well that's not going to fly. You don't know who you're dealing with!}]

[woman: "Cerulean is it, today?"]

[me: {It's not me you should be afraid of, this is wrath of God type stuff. You may have the upper hand in technology in some way--but what sees through my eyes has a lot more than this crap.}]

{I knocked her black rotary phone off the desk and bopped her on the head with a nearby water bottle before waking up.}
