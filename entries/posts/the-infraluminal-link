    {I believed that I was awake and writing down a dream. However, I noticed a man in my room with me and realized I'd had a false awakening. As I followed him out into the kitchen he became very small and impish and looked like a leprechaun. I cornered him and told him I didn't want to fight, I just wanted to talk.}

    {He came out with the sharp end of a coathanger and told me he'd talk, but he didn't know if he could trust me yet and so he was going to keep his coathanger armed. I didn't feel very threatened by that so I said it was fine. I asked him what he was doing here and he said "Playing Apples."}

    {Next thing I knew he'd turned into a laptop on my kitchen table. A video began playing about some effort with a name like "A 9 5 9" which had to do with emulation or something, and I nodded along "Yes, yes, I've heard of this"}

note "I have not actually heard of this."

    {I watched as receipts started printing out, I began pulling them into piles. They were receipts for music purchases including Dave Gahan's *[Saw Something](http://youtube.com/watch?v=3VWJvpnJJdY)*, as well as other items. Some were entirely music store receipts. I had a very haunted feeling about it all, and sprung into action gathering them.}

    {The next thing I started noticing is that I was looking at shreds of documents coming out. I went to the top and noticed I was looking at the output of a paper shredder with a huge input queue. Pulling all the papers out and putting them in a group with all the receipts and shreds, I saw a girl who looked like a crying clown standing there.}

dialog [her: {Thanks for doing that. I just wanted to know if what I already knew was true. And it is. Wish it hadn't have been, I can't believe how far they'll go. It's the nearest body of water to which I am located, I can take care of it.}]

print "I went over and gave her a hug."

dialog [me: {Yes, well it's like that for me ALL THE TIME. I hate having to do the tests but I do.}]

print {Her body changed into something more like an attractive model in a swimsuit. She didn't seem to have a fixed size, she kept getting larger and smaller.}

dialog [

    me: {What are you? What kind of creature, or what kind of thing...I mean.}

    her: <Smiling weakly.> {I'm just squares on a board. A custom apprentice(?) version.}

]

note {Though I didn't assume it at the time, squares on a board seems like a clear reference to a [circuit board](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board).}

dialog [

    me: "Wait...wait...okay, so what am I?"

    her: {I don't know if I should tell you. You'll get a big head, or at least be like 'what's this old person talking to *me* for'.}

    me: "Please, I'd like to know."

    her: "You're an influliminal link..."

]

print {The last sentence was incomplete and I abruptly woke up. It contained that "i" word that I don't know.}

note {Trying "influliminal" on Google gave me "did you mean infraluminal?" and that sounds like it could have been it. That would mean "beneath the speed of light".}
