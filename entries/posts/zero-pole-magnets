[{I was in some kind of store where I could purchase VR 3-D models that were animated. It let you look at and hold the models for a limited time (mine were of construction tractors) and then it would kick you out of the previewing room. My preview time was running out, and I was being pushed out of the room and began falling down toward the floor of something.}]
[{Rather than be afraid, I decided to do my best to land safely. I was on the ground floor of some kind of tall building, and I decided to yell out for help.}]
[me: "Help! Take me to customer service."]
[{To my surprise I started flying up into the air. The grayish columnar building I was in gave way to another building that looked more like a conventional set of apartments. As I approached walls and structures I just floated right through them, and I was deposited into an office. A few people were around, but I was at the desk of a particular woman.}]
[me: "How is it that I can just go through these walls?"]
[her: {Because you're free right now. And I mean <i>free</i> as in...<i><u>not</u> free</i>.}]
[note {She was making some kind of joke that I didn't really understand, but that I interpreted to say that I was not a paying customer of her business, and thus I was a second-class citizen in terms of how I was treated and what I was allowed to do.}]
[me: {What's happening? I'm from the year 2000. Where am I, what is this?}]
[woman: {Time isn't really...Look, you're in the same place you always are, which is the <i>omniverse</i>. And you're going through a <i>neurofissure reconstruction</i> right now.}]
[note {I made up the word neurofissure here because I can't remember the one she said, but it sounded kind of like that. Dealt with brains.}]
[me: {I don't know what that is. Can you explain? Actually, can you show me something I can take back and use as proof of having been here?}]
[{An office worker passing by stopped and put in his two cents.}]
[office-worker: {What would you do with your day tomorrow if you had it?}]
[me: {I'd write it down. Go to a restaurant with a cute girl at some point. Be happier because the world would listen to me 'cause I'm provably not insane.}]
[woman: "Cute girls aren't that interesting."]
[me: {Well *I* like them, but it's really just aesthetics. And that wasn't the point, I just meant to say that my needs are modest and I really am just looking for validation. I need you to show me something.}]
[{A video showing a magnet with a configuration of holes in it flashed before my eyes. It looked like a cube built out of several layers of material.}]
[woman: {I can show you how to make a zero-pole-magnet. And NO, not the <i>dumb</i> way. Actually it's already been invented and the inventor isn't doing anything with it...you can look him up, his name is...}]
["She said some name here I forget."]
[me: "Names never work, can you show me how it's made?"]
[woman: {Really you should just look up the paper. Though you're only 25, so it's not surprising it's tough for me to understand.}]
[note {I didn't correct her on my age. Only now do I notice that naming the year as 2000 might have thrown off an age estimate. Had it really been the year 2000, that would have been correct.}]
[me: {I think I deserve some slack, considering that I am able to achieve basic dialogue while asleep.}]
[{I didn't get any more information before I rather suddenly woke up.}]
[note {Apparently a torus is already a zero-pole magnet, but may be the "dumb way" since there's no strong field on the outside, thus it wouldn't stick to a refrigerator. I sparked <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sci.physics.electromag/browse_thread/thread/775043800f39f76/350f8963233e7a9f?hide_quotes=no">this discussion on Usenet</a> which seemed to suggest there's not a good way to build a strong magnet with no external poles.}]
