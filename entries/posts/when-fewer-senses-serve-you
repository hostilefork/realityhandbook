print {We're all familiar with the typical colorblindness "dot" patterns in which colorblind people can't see the number. Today I saw a counterexample where the colorblind have the leg up:}

    {If you're colorblind, you'll easily see the number 5 above--it'll just jump right off the page. Color sensing people should be able to make out a blue-pink-purple 5 in the mess of color now that I've mentioned it...but it's less obvious because your greater ability to see the other color distinctions makes this appear very "noisy".}

    {It's an interesting example where people who are more sensitive might well be considered to be "missing the obvious"...and points to how having a sense that other people do not have can be problematic, leading you to lack another sense.}

    {My own senses--while awake--are probably very poor. I know I don't see very well (without glasses) and my sense of smell is not very good, plus my touch is reduced by something known as [Raynaud's Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raynaud%27s_disease). I'll eat pretty much anything without complaint, though I think I can describe tastes pretty well...still, I'm average at best in this area. I tend to hear things others do not, so my ears might be better than average.}
