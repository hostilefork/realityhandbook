[{I was waiting in line at some kind of food counter and saw an attractive blond girl who seemed to recognize me. She sidled up to me and I touched her, I was in some kind of awareness that I was dreaming.}]
[me: "Um, hey, sorry is that ok?"]
[blond: ("smiling") "I'm a uni."]
[me: "Uni what? Are you in some kind of... union?"]
["She didn't answer that."]
[blond: "Where are you from?"]
[me: "Um... the year 2000?"]
[blond: "Which part? Earth?"]
[me: "Yes."]
["Her smile disappeared."]
[blond: "That is not looked upon highly."]
[me: "Hey, well me neither, I didn't like it very much."]
[blond: {Well just because you're here now, this isn't because of anything about you... you just slipped through a crack in the fabric.}]
[me: {Look, I'm not asking for anything. Please don't attack me. I just want to know how I got here, and what's going to happen to me in the future.}]
[blond: "Well, there is a screening process."]
[{We began walking through a very beautiful and refined mall-type environment, a classier version of the wacky and well done interiors of certain Vegas casinos.}]
[blond: "Your world was too competive."]
[me: "You mean, com-pet-it-ive?"]
[blond: {Yes, a lot of contention for resources. Here hotel rooms are given out on a first-come, first-serve basis. For example. There are exceptions, but few.}]
[me: {That sounds nice in theory, but what do you do when there are people who are pathological? The homeless who cannot or will not work?}]
[blond: ("smiling") "I kill them."]
[me: {What?! You, personally, kill people just because they don't have homes?}]
[blond: {There are many military operations, I'm part of some.}]
[me: {Well there has to be a better way! If you're all evolved and we're such dumb schmucks, can't you come up with something more elegant than extermination?}]
[{I woke up kinda pissed off as we walked into a club-like area.}]
