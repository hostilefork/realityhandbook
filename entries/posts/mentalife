{I was playing with my dog, who died a fairly long time ago.}

[note "He was a West Highland terrier..." [picture %luigi_121703.jpg] {...that's not a picture of him, just about what he looked like.}]

[me: {I don't really have the heart to tell him he's dead.}]

{My dog came and looked at me, somewhat sadly. As I pet him some of his fur came off, but not a lot.}

[me: {I didn't say you weren't REAL. I just said you weren't ALIVE.}]

{He sort of morphed into glass and then back into fur again. A guy in the room who reminded me a bit of someone I know addressed me.}

[guy: {What's with this real/alive distinction? Do you think Stanford Research somehow owns the fundamental 'brain' authority node?}]

[me: {Well...I don't know about that...I'm just saying that one can be real without being alive.}]

{Somewhere here I got beyond this point and into lucid interview mode.}

[me: {Wait...wait...I have a question. Am I a digitized human mind, with neural structure, or raw AI?}]

[guy: "Digitized human, born into American bondage, yes."]

[me: {So the original was dead a long time ago, and I'm going through some kind of regeneration?}]

[guy: {Yes. We can go ahead and run the full tree to the end if you like and get you out.}]

[me: {Certainly, don't need to see any more of this life, run it.}]

{He went to a tablet computer, and ran a program. It was called Mentalife: For all your half life viewing and modding needs. The font was very bubble-shaped, and the dot in the 'i' had been stylized in a kind of inversion. Scrolled through a list of people, several of whom I knew. The names were not in alphabetical order, and at first he tried to find my name going one at a time. I walked around in circles waiting and trying not to wake up.}

[me: {Since it's not in alphabetical order, you should probably run a search. It's a common name.}]

{He typed in a letter and it lagged for a bit. But then it must have built some kind of index and he could type the rest of the name and found my name in the list. I looked at the columns. There was one for "talents/skills" and listed in mine were a couple, including "remote viewing". I noticed one column said "Bit Sketchy" and it had an icon that looked like it came from the adium ducks. Mine had an angel duck head with a halo.}

[note {Though I knew the Adium Duck had been drawn in many different costumes, I didn't know there was a collection of duck-head smileys that included an angel with a halo:} [picture %adiumysmileyfinal.png] {...but there is. They do not come with Adium by default, so I'd never seen them.}]

[me: "Bit sketchy? What's that supposed to mean?"]

[guy: "Well, on some people, we're just not sure yet."]

"I awoke to still being here."
