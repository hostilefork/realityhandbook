{I was riding in the back seat of a car when I realized I was dreaming. The passenger side was occupied by a statue-like woman with a mask that looked like something out of Phantom of the Opera. I asked her about contacting someone and what they were doing... conversation went roughly like this:}

[me: "What is she doing?"]

[face: "She is doing what she wants."]

[me: "What am I doing?"]

[face: {You've moved on, you are ready for this battle to end.}]

{Over the course of our conversation her head was falling apart in various ways but I did my best to ignore this.}

[me: "Well, what is important to *you*?"]

[face: "I am about art."]

[me: "I suppose that's true of me as well."]

{At this point the face was completely decomposed in a disturbing way, but I stared straight into it.}

[me: {Do you know what you look like to me, now, while I am looking at you?}]

[face: "No. I have lost touch."]

[note {Something about the delivery and context of "I have lost touch" gave me chills.}]

[me: "What do I look like to you?"]

[face: "My bag is very high on the vacuum."]

[me: {It sounds like you said 'my bag is very high on the vacuum'... what does that mean?}]

{At this point the face turned into a translucent mask and started floating away. I narrated the fact that I saw it getting higher and attempted to see if it could come back to the sound of my voice, but it didn't--and I woke up.}

[note {Though the bag/vacuum comment seems like a pretty big non-sequitur, it could have been an attempt to say something like "the perspective of my body is in a higher ethereal dimension".}]
