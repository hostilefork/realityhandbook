note {The date on this entry is very approximate, as I documented it long after the fact due to its lasting significance.}

print {In a non-lucid dream I was visiting a fortune teller, and felt a little awkward to be there. It was hot, and a fan was running behind her desk.}

dialog [

    me: "How much is this going to cost?"

    fortune-teller: "It will be $20 per hour."

print {Realizing that I'd only been there 15 minutes so far, and that this was pretty cheap entertainment, I decided to relax.}

dialog [

    me: "Okay that's fine. I'll take one hour then."

    fortune-teller: {The most important thing you need to learn about is going to be the concept of *sether*. It was outlined best in a book by...}

print {When I woke up, my face was toward a fan next to my bed that was running.}

note [

    print {I'd never heard the word 'sether' before, nor had I ever studied Tarot--despite taking a few paranormal things seriously, I skip horoscopes and tarot. But looking up sether up on Google I found the word mentioned in a PDF file [Oracle of the Tarot](http://www.tarot.org.il/Library/PFCase/Oracle%20of%20the%20Tarot.pdf), which says:}

    quote {The special mode of consciousness associated in Hebrew Wisdom with 7 is the Occult or Secret intelligence. The Hebrew word here translated "Occult or Secret" is [...] Sether, signifying "to shut up, to cover, to hide, to veil, to conceal."}

    print {...which seems like the very kind of word that a real fortune teller might bring up in a visit.}
