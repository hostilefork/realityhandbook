    {I was tinkering with a fancy phone.  There was a weird branding on it in abbreviation, and it was called something like NJAP which expanded to be "Not Just A Phone".}

    {I noticed it was able to slide open to have a keyboard.  But once slid open like that, I felt another mechanism underneath it.  It slid out to be even bigger, producing more parts as I tugged on it...expanding out speakers, a piano keyboard, etc.  It became unreasonably big.}

    {I was taking some notes, talking to another guy...when I called out to the phone "play some Mesh".  Some music started playing which I identified as a Pet Shop Boys song.}
]

note {"Mesh" is a British synth-pop band I've listened to in the past years, and really liked.  I saw them play live in Austin.}

dialog [
    guy: <amused> "The words are right on that.  Now the question of the hour is: who's that voice singing it."

    me: <still scribbling notes> "No clue."
]

print {Like some other devices of this nature, I was able to stretch it out to make it bigger.  I began a communication (not on the phone) with a girl who I somehow related to the musician who goes by POE, and addressed her as such.}

dialog [
    girl: "Don't call me that!"

    me: "Do you talk to me because there's something special?  How is it you are talking to me?"

    girl: "Well, you get special treatment.  We can read what you're trying to say, and then image back."

print {I began floating around in a giant epic rendered landscape, like something out of a vast modern animated movie.}

dialog [
    me: "What is this?  Who built all this?"

    voice: "This was built in a version of the world that doesn't have all the problems you've seen in yours.  I think you understand that without those severe handicaps, a tremendous amount more could be accomplished."

print {A strangee being materialized and hugged me.}

dialog [
    being: "Always remember--you will die, I will die, everything will.  We will achieve great things, great unifications.  It is on the horizon.  But even with all of that, things must end at some point.  They *have* to."

print {Somewhere after this, there was a bizarre detour in a room with someone who wanted to ask on behalf of "Hola's restaurant" if they could change their bridge playing database account so their name could be Benjamin.  :-/}
