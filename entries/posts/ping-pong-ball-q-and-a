print {I was showering and a girl I know was in the same bathroom. She kept poking in behind the curtain.}

dialog [girl: "Oh, I forgot someone else I knew was in here."]

print {There was a mirror in the shower, and I noticed I had a ton of hair.}

dialog [

    me: {Okay, I just shaved my head, so this is...a dream. I should have known anyway, given the somewhat neurotic bathroom theme! It's question time.}

    girl: "What kind of questions?"

    me: "Existential questions, I suppose."

]

print {She led me down the hall to a desk where a strange-looking being was seated behind a computer. He had a bunch of ping-pong balls.}

dialog [

    being: "Have you been here before?"

    me: {No. But then again, I guess I don't have a great memory of this kind of thing. I might have been here and forgotten.}

    being: {If you want to continue the questioning, then you will have to retrieve these balls as I throw them.}

]

print {Retrieving the balls was a distraction, but I did it.}

dialog [

    me: {I'm interested in knowing how this reality is connected to my waking life.}

    being: {Well, people like you are extremely rare. Sometimes we can send YouTube movies to other worlds, but getting certain shows on can require taking a planet's entire legal system and all their lawyers out and putting new ones in.}

note {I think that is a bad capture of what he was intending, but his point was about the delicate network of dependencies and that although one might exist at a seeming higher plane of power and control...the tools are not such that one can make sudden random changes that the infrastructure does not support.}

dialog [me: {That sounds a lot like the kinds of problems you face in bootstrapping software. So I appreciate the difficulty. But this room doesn't have anything particularly high-tech or incredible...if you can reload planets then why isn't this office more impressive? Why can't you shoot beams of light out of your hand, or something?}]

print {He held out his hand and a yellow block of color started bouncing between it and the floor.}

dialog [me: "That's pretty cool, will that work for me too?"]

print {I held my hand out and a similar yellow block started bouncing.}

dialog [me: {I'd rather that instead of bouncing at an even rate that it would get faster each time it hit the ground.}]

print {Despite explaining what I wanted out loud, it didn't react--it just kept bouncing at the initial rate.}

dialog [

    me: {What's the programming infrastructure for this? You must have a way to implement the semantics.}

    being: {That's a great point! You've actually said something very important here...not many good questions that give ME questions...}

note "I am not sure if that was sarcasm or not."

print {He began scribbling on a pad and left out the hallway. I tried to follow him, but realized he was going too fast...so I turned around to examine the room I'd been in. When I did turn around, an arm grabbed at me and I reflexively bit it--taking a huge chunk of flesh out it which I spat out.}

dialog [me: {I'm very sorry, that wasn't very friendly. I feel terrible about it.}]

print {The woman I had bit seemed not to mind that much, and her arm healed quickly as I watched.}

dialog [me: {See, in dreams, a lot of times I get attacked from behind or the side by people who pinch me until I wake up.}]

print {When I said that, she initiated that precise annoying reach-around pinch hold. She said nothing, and I decided I'd try not fighting...but just see how long I could hold out and peacefully request disengagement.}

dialog [me: {What's with you people? What do you call this? *Why* are you doing it? Please stop.}]
