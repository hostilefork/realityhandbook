{I was playing with a digital book, and the pages had floating windows on them that I could peel off. When I stretched the pages the pixels would deform, and as I ripped one of the pages I was surprised to see that the piece I had torn became a much paler color.}

{As I pushed around various areas in the book, music I was listening to would change--and one of the songs was a Sarah Mclachlan tune I didn't recognize. My eyes wandered to a mirror on the wall and I noticed that I was wearing headphones, and I could see there were several people on a bed in the other side of the room. There were lots of vials and pills on a dresser.}

[me: "Ummm...do I do drugs here?"]

{They pointed at the counter, and one of them expressed distress.}

[girl: "Are you wigging out?!"]

[me: {Look...don't worry about me. Just quit doing drugs. And don't let ME do drugs!!}]
