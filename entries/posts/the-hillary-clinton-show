{As one part of a dream, I was watching something called "The Hillary Clinton Show". It was about a parallel universe where Hillary had won the election. Though the sets and many of the characters were live action, Hillary and some others were animated--it was a mixture like <i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</i>.}

{Obama was still around occupying some post in the administration, but a recurring aspect was the mean things she would do to get him out of the way. If there was some major vote or meeting she would cause a catastrophe for him. Much later, then the (live-action) Obama character would show up and be very polite but suspicious about what had happened to him.}
