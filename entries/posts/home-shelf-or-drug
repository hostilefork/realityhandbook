{I was walking through some rooms with a girl and pondering the word "Atillon" for some reason. I looked it up on a device I was carrying the definition came up as rack, or shelf.}

[me: {I had the notion that it meant 'home' for some reason. It sounds French.}]

[girl: {If it were French it would be pronounced *atillion* instead.}]

[me: {But rack or shelf... hm... well, that could be considered home if you're a computer. Like a server rack, you know.}]

[note {It's the brand name for a cancer-treatment drug called [Tegafur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tegafur), that I've never heard of.}]

{As it happened, the rooms we were passing through had a lot of cabling, wires, and racks. Things seemed rather disorderly, but people seemed to be ignoring us and working on putting things in order.}

[me: "What is it we're looking for here again, anyway?"]

[girl: "I think that's our clue over there."]

{She pointed to a white door which had the doorknob painted bright purple. We opened it to reveal a room that was dark like someone's old garage, and had more technical junk inside of it. There were tons of post-its and sticky labels on things, and some were difficult to read. Several of them were labeled as DMV records.}

[me: {Maybe this is a clue, something about people involved with The Long Now?}]

[girl: <puzzled> "Where do you see that?"]

[me: {Well this tape says LON and this other one says NOW, and they're right next to each other. Could be nothing I guess.}]
