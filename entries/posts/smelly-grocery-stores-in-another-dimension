{An extended dream turned into a circumstance where a rabbit had bit my finger, hanging on to it. In order to get it off I had to beat my hand against the ground, which killed the rabbit. The owner of the rabbit was upset with me.}

[owner: "Why didn't you rewind time and resurrect it?!"]

[me: {Well, the further away you are from an incident mentally, the harder it gets to roll back the event. Your consciousness has drifted too far. But I can try.}]

{I shut my eyes and had her pinch my hand to try and simulate the rabbit bite, with the goal of "taking myself back to the moment" and choosing a different path. But the rabbit didn't materialize on my finger.}

[me: {I'm sorry. It's just too late. I can't bring it back now.}]

{This interaction actually triggered me into lucidity--and I wound up at a crowded store speaking to the people there. I talked to the cashier behind the counter, who was an old and somewhat decayed man...who was nonetheless freely engaging me in conversation.}

[me: {I'm relieved that this store isn't some kind of horror-show and was kind of basically nice, because so many places I was seeing had become hellish.}]

[cashier: "Oh no, then the demons have won!"]

[me: {They haven't won yet. Efforts are proceeding, and I am in communication with some very advanced beings that were doing the best they could.}]

"I had to use the restroom, so I went into one."

[me: {Well, this bathroom isn't bad either. That's a good sign because often when I do such dream-visitations, the bathrooms are really disgusting.}]

[someone: {This store isn't that nice. In fact, the whole place smells like farts.}]

{After we were finished in the bathroom, they took me to a store they thought was nicer, which was actually labeled outside as "Trader Joe's".}

[note {[Trader Joe's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trader_Joe%27s) is a real grocery chain, though this place looked more like a [Hickory Farms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hickory_Farms)}]

{The store was not very crowded. I was trying to understand the price scheme of the items, and so I picked up a piece of cheese that was wrapped in plastic and had a price label on it that I could not read.}

[me: {Could you buy this to put on a sandwich, and not think much of the expense? I mean, is it affordable to the average person?}]

[shopper: "Yes, it is easy to afford that."]

{Trying to read the label, I noticed that the numbers kept changing out from under me. I commented on their volatility, and started reciting what I read as they changed. A woman in line behind me said something.}

[woman: {It's nice that you rant while you're dreaming. We're going to report you for everything you say here.}]

{Instinctively I grabbed her and felt the urge to strangle her. But I backed off.}

[me: {Sorry about that, but you made me angry. What is the reason for you treating me like a criminal?}]

[woman: {We have to stop immigration, or there would be too many.}]

[me: {Is that any justification for creating confusion!? Why can't you educate people about your immigration policies, while still enforcing them?}]

[note {If this idea that studying me to stop immigration mechanisms is true, then it paints a more negative picture of the reasons behind why I might not face attacks in circumstances like this.}]
