{I was speaking to a woman and going through one of my usual lucid "how is it we're talking" rants. I waved my dream-arms and dream-legs.}

[me: {Look, I have a body that I walk around in during the day and it's a lot like this one. Well, it *seems* a lot like this one. I have arms, and legs...}]

[woman: {We can connect to you, because we can connect... you have a Pocky...}]

{She continued to rant about some kind of procedure I didn't understand for connecting with me.}

[me: "My Pocky? What are you talking about?"]

[note {I didn't think about it at the time, but I think this was a mispronunciation of PC. I definitely thought she was talking about some relation to the candy, Pocky.}]

[woman: {This is surprising and we are going to need to change the marriage. But if you like females then you like females, whatever. It doesn't make a difference as far as I am concerned. But it's going to have to get approved; I think we can file for it and push it through.}]

[me: {Yes this... you look good, but... what are you? If you aren't human then how is it you can speak English?}]

[woman: "What makes you think I speak in English?"]

[me: {Oh. I guess one's entire life could be a translation layer, and you'd never know.}]

[woman: {In a manner of speaking, ultimately your whole life could be a translation layer.}]
