    {I was trying to log into Yahoo! mail through an interface that allowed you to provide an arbitrary number of passwords. So if you wanted to prove to the site that you were "more certainly" you, then you would start entering more information.}

    {There were also hints, so you could provide a custom password-retrieving question in case you'd forgotten. One of the hints that showed up in a combo box was "84.9 fm".}

note {I remember that number vividly because I woke up immediately afterward and jotted it down. There's a web streaming switzerland radio station called [Penguin Radio](http://www.penguinradio.com/station/446) that operates at that frequency and comes up first on Google...but I'm sure there are many others.}
