{I was in a room with several odd shaped things. They morphed a lot. I asked them questions and they were giving answers for a fair amount of time. One thing looked like a giant plush blue shark, but a friendly one.}

[shark: {You are just so very *good*. We are trying to work out what is best for you.}]

[me: {Thank you, I try to be. I need to know what's going on though. I need to know, y'know, is there a God behind it all? Can I have faith in improvement or is this just going to be more nonsense ad nauseum?}]

[shark: {We think of God more as...well, more like a 'preservative'...so that is the model we use when creating architecture.}]

[note {When I woke up, I thought of the joke "Q: What do God and Disodium EDTA have in common? A: If you look hard enough, you'll find them in a bottle of salad dressing." Which I think is pretty funny.}]
