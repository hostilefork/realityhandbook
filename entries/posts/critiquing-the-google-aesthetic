{I had a dream discussion with people who were challenging the Google aesthetic.}

[first-man: {Their cafeterias are a metaphor for the problem, all bright and institutional. Like kindergarten.}]

[second-man: {if Google had its way, they would turn the whole universe into a plastic and color-coded world, missing the subtlety of artistic sensibility.}]

[note ["What they were talking about was comparing this:" [picture %IMG_0628.jpg] "...with:" [picture %jerk11.jpg] "...and suggesting the latter is a better trend."]]

[me: {I think color-coding is an important concept for organizing information. Plus, I've often felt like we're living inside of a computer, and being careless with the use of color for decorative purposes doesn't work out well.}]
