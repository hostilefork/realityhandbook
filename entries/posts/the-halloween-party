[{There were people around me dressed in costumes, with vampire teeth. I questioned them.}]
[me: {Where do you guys go for guidance? What sort of teachings or earth-based groups will help give pointers on how to deal with this environment? Ok, for instance, Scientology...Eckanar...anyone deal with these groups?}]
[{No one answered, people were basically in their own world. The costume-party atmosphere was especially distracting. It made me wonder if I was wearing a costume.}]
[{Finding a mirror and looking in it I saw that I was dressed normally, although my shirt was unbuttoned. Outside of the costumed hooligans, I saw some ordinary folks...like a Mexican guy just standing against a wall.}]
[me: "How about you?"]
[mexican: "I don't like Scientology."]
[me: "Ok, but what DO you like?"]
[{At this point I realized the environment was rather stark and childish. Someone with a gun device shot a toothpick into my thumb, and it hurt...the kind of pain that would ordinarily wake me up. Avoiding a couple more flying toothpicks, I removed the one from my thumb.}]
[{Realizing I was in a house of hostile juveniles I decided to exit, but I was being followed. I went out the door to the front of the house, but picked up a stick and hid behind the door. They hadn't gone out the same door I had, so I had some time to take in the front of the house. The address was "333" and it was a familiar brick facade.}]
[{My foes eventually showed up, carrying some posts. My stick was ready.}]
[me: ("menacingly") {Oh, THERE you are! Not used to seeing someone who's onto you, are you?}]
[{They ran, but unfortunately I was stuck to the wall behind the door and woke up.}]
