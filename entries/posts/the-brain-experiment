{I was in a crowd of people sitting in what felt like a somewhat boring community center, talking to an old bearded man in a hat. My curiosity had been raised about a woman with a name like Perry Ellis.}

[note {Perry Ellis is a male fashion designer and clothing label brand, though I'm sure other people with the name exist.}]

"Perry"

{had been one of the first subjects in something known as "The Brain Experiment". Now--something like ten or twenty years later--she was giving some kind of talk or coming forward about the experiment. The man spoke about the incident gravely and in a very protracted fashion.}

[me: {I'm sorry, but can you tell the story at the view from a mile up... then after that 400 feet... and so on? I need to hear some summary of the <i>complete</i> story before you fill in the details, because I could wake up any moment now.}]

{At that point, my field of view changed to a web browser that had popped up--as if I had clicked on a link and the page was being fetched. Nothing was happening, so I opened another tab and tried to fire up Google...but when I did, I saw a page with light-blue text of someone else's name with a search box. I typed "Perry Ellis" into the search box expecting a Wikipedia page to come up first, but it didn't--instead I got a few links, one of which was on answers.com where someone was asking why they couldn't find any information on Perry Ellis.}
