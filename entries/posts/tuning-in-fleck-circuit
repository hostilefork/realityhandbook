print {I'd had some sort of incident with interacting with a computer window where something reached out from the image and was able to touch me in some way.  At a point after that I was talking with people about it.}

dialog [
    announcer: "Has an image of a baby ever scared you?"

    girl: "It was probably just you tuning in and crossing against a few people sitting around watching Fleck Circuit or something."

note {I'm oddly confident the actual 'show' named was "Fleck Circuit".  Google search reveals there are "Fleck Circuitboards" for some kind of reverse osmosis water systems.  :-/}

dialog [
    me: "But it came out and attacked me, and bit me.  Can it do that, these shows you decribe?"

    girl: "Sure, of course."

    me: "Okay it *can* but why would you be intentionally watching something that allowed that?"

    girl: "Because you're not allowed to see the show otherwise if you disable the possibility.  It's part of the price of admission, you might say."

    me: "Hmm.  I do remember seeing something about some kind of interactive VR porn which had a clause like that.  It was a condition like 'you could only watch if you had a camera on you repeating the actions that the characters were doing' or they would kick you out.  Is that something you're aware of?"

    girl: "Yup, it's like that."
