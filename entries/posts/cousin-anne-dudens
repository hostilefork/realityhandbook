{I was in a building that was a lot like an airport, with long hallways and big windows along one wall. There were people around, so I spoke to them.}

[me: {Have any of you heard of Earth? Or the World Wide Web?}]

[them: "Yes, we know of Earth."]

[me: {Do you know about the September 11th attacks? Terrorists flew airplanes into the Twin Towers in New York, causing them to collapse.}]

{Some people were rather surprised to hear about this. But a person brought up a video on one of the large windows. It was of the skyline of New York before and after the twin towers were destroyed--there was a lot of smoke in the "after" picture. I kept talking even though my perception was getting quite fuzzy.}

[guy: {I've heard of your internet handle before. My cousin is also from Earth, and her name is Anne Dudens.}]

[me: "Could you spell that?"]

[guy: "It is spelled the way it sounds."]

[note {There is an Anne Duden(s), who is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anne-Duden-Revolution-Approaches-Fiction/dp/9042011343">somewhat famous German poet</a>.}]
