print {I was out on a populous dark street, speaking with a woman who was telling me a joke.}

dialog [
    woman: "What do blowfish, a six pack of beer, and gay people have in common?"

    me: "I...don't know?"

    woman: <grinning> "They all want to stick a lot of things in you."

    {There seemed to be a lot of people around, but the environment was fairly cluttered and trashy; as if we were in a street that had become a homeless encampment.  I was approached by a woman in something resembling a nurse's outfit, carrying something with a sign on it that said "Relief: Sponsored by AirBnB".}

    {I was becoming lucid and was curious what she was handing out--though I was instantly suspicious it was a scam.  I put out my hand and was expecting her to put some pills in it, but wasn't prepared to see that they were little rigid-seeming plastic V-shaped strips.  They seemed to stand up on my palm on their own.}

    {The Vs unfolded and were warm and stuck to me.  They began to burn, creating a rather strong pain--though I managed to avoid waking.  I was unable to peel them off--the adhesion was strong, as if they'd superglued to my skin.}

    {With the nurse having walked away, the woman who had joked before looked at my hand solemnly.}

dialog [
    woman: "I get the trick.  They are a kind of strong automatic medical bandage--usually legitimate.  But these ones have been modified to *create* wounds.  The perpetrators make money on the backside at their clinics--they charge for the treatments of the wounds the bandages are now covering..."

    me: <rolling eyes> "...and then the government pays it; the people here are too drugged up to ever know what happened.  Assumption is that it was just addicts who hurt themselves.  Godawful.  I hope that when those responsible are killed, it is performed...slowly."

    {Wanting to see what else I could glean from the dystopian environment, I wandered off from the street into a building which had a propped open door.  I went into a community room where people were watching a television.}

    {Ignoring the people watching it, I just went to muck with the TV and see what kind it was.  All the controls I could see were on the front.  One was a sliding toggle, which had a setting for closed-captioning.  I ticked it on.  Yellow writing began to run on the bottom of the screen.}

dialog [
    tv-viewer: {Whoa.  How did you do that?  Get those words to show up?}

    me: {It's called "Closed-Captioning".  It's for deaf people usually.  But for my current situation, really anything helps.  Maybe it will help you too.}

    {I watched a bit of the end of a show I couldn't quite follow--and then the opening of a cartoon called "Beetron".  The animation was fairly lo-fi, and the hero of "Beetron" looked rather similar to the low-budget-costumed "bee guy" character from the Simpsons (who plays a slapstick role on a Mexican sitcom).  The theme song gave me the impression that it was a comedy--that Beetron was similarly goofy, and bad at being a superhero.}

    {After taking in a little bit of Beetron, I turned my attention to the people on the couch who were watching me.}

dialog [
    me: "Hello there, humans!  Or, are you?  I'm not.  Well...what I mean to say is, that I have a human body elsewhere...I don't know what I am right now or how I'm talking to you.  But I presume it's some other body.  Anyone want to tell me anything?"

print {A man on a couch pointed at some posters on the wall for what looked like movies and TV shows.}

dialog [
    couch-guy: {We still have carpool karaoke.  But it's not any good anymore.  They shouldn't even be bothering to make it.}

    me: {So...who am I, to you?}

    couch-guy: {You are a member of a party of people who are usually found in Prague.  But your party is not as powerful as it used to be.}

    me: {I'm not part of any political party.  I'm more a member of the...Jesus party.}
]

print {Everyone in the room freaked out, and a small young girl jumped up and clung to me.}

dialog [
    little-girl: <horrified> "Didn't you know?  You can't say Jesus!"
]

print {A noise happened and some kind of alarm or alert went off.  There was a buzzing.  I tried to push the girl off of me.}

dialog [
    me: <resignedly> "Oh, this always happens.  Look, don't worry about me, just save yourself.  I'll be fine."

print << [
    {Though I had walked in on a ground level, I either had gone up stairs at some point or the building was split level.  Because I could look down a window and see where a small machine that looked like an odd remote control car was running along.}

    {I had told the girl to let go of me, but she wouldn't.  She tugged me to hide with her in a dark corner.  The little car eventually came our way but it passed us, seemingly not seeing us.  We waited and I assumed it would find me (as such things usually do).  But it ran by and kept going the other direction.}

    {Though I was surprised to get out of that unscathed, I then noticed it had dropped a small device near us as it passed.  I wondered if it was a bomb.  But eventually it started rolling toward us and ran directly into my foot.}

    {I woke up.}
