{I was walking down a hallway and had to keep stopping to spit seeds out of my mouth into a bathroom. Then I got to another bathroom and had more seeds, so I spat those out. I put some in my hand and they were wet, and seemed to be vibrating a bit. I carried them down stairs and found a man there.}

[me: "Please help, what are these seeds?"]

[man: ("looking") {Oh, those are [name]...it's what those kangaroos were all so worried about. Shouldn't be a problem.}]

[me: {But they *are* a problem. They keep growing in my mouth. When I spit them out, they seem to grow in my hands too.}]

[man: "Oh. Hmmm."]

[note {I documented a similar contagion in a dream where I described <a href="http://realityhandbook.org/lucid-dream/budding-mouth-disease/">budding mouth disease</a>}]

{Throwing the seeds onto the ground, the man bent over to look at them. He squeezed the seed so he could look at the inside.}

[man: "Yes, the problem is, these are *yours*. Look."]

[me: ("squatting") "What am I supposed to look at about them?"]

[man: "You have to open them up to see."]

{He squeezed one of the seeds in some way that it expanded to a large size, and I could see that inside it were two chambers. The chambers were filled with a whitish goo. One chamber was fatter and had a slightly different shade of goo in it.}

[man: {Half of that is from a goat, which is probably where you caught it. But the other half is coming from you. This means you still have human DNA, so you're still on the wrong floor(?)}]

[me: "How do I get to the right place?"]

[man: {You have to find [name] and Erin Robertson, they'll know.}]

[me: {Is this the same Erin who was connected with Monty Python?}]

[man: "Yes."]

[note {I may have that name wrong, it was hard to remember, but Erin was the first name. How I knew the Monty Python connection is unknownst to me...and I can't find any Erins affiliated with Monty Python on the web, other than as fans.}]

[me: {How do I get in touch with them? Can anyone you know contact them?}]

[man: "I'm afraid not."]
