print {So I was in a state where I could hear some guy talking, and then I could talk back. I could still sort of feel the bed and the pillows, but knew I was talking to a disembodied voice. The conversation went a little like this:}

dialog [

    voice: "Testing. Can you hear this?"

    me: "Yes."

    voice: {Hm, good, I don't really... know... how this works.}

    me: "Ah, well, what's your name?"

    voice: "The destroyer."

    me: "Cool name, I guess, though what is it you destroy?"

    voice: "People."

print {I elected to wake up rather than continue a conversation with that clown. The rest of the night I slept pretty well, off and on, with no more commentary from "The Destroyer".}

note {I was a little disturbed for a while, wondered what would happen if some Freddy Kruegerish entity decided to make my life miserable by haunting my dreams after finding out I could hear him. But someone who can't even get the matrix microphone working is hardly as formidable as the other things I've seen and done.}
