{I was in my bed using a computer that I could tell was not mine, attempting to document a dream. That helped trigger me into knowing I was dreaming.}

{So I started poking around the computer for a web browser. I found Firefox, but the icon was a black and white illustration of a fox--something that looked like it was from the Mac Classic era.}

{As I was working, I noticed some people around me. One of them came up to me and looked at my eyes and opened them up a little wider.}

[man: {Oh, yes, we have to adjust to 30 frames-per-second.}]

{There was an improvement, and the room seemed more vivid and stable. I followed the man toward some kind of spacious cafeteria.}

[me: {How can reality have a framerate? What is the nature of this world? Is the world I live in some kind of simulation.}]

[man: {Yes, pretty much. You're using a particular set of geo-tapes...}]

{I rattled off the date and time I was from as best I could remember it.}

[man: "Look at the cars outside."]

{I went to the window and peeked out at the cityscape. These long, snakelike trucks were moving in a very unusual way, with heads and tails like a train--symmetrical. I recognized that one was a UPS brown with the shipping logo.}

[me: ("excited") "Yes, I remember this... I've seen this before!"]

[note {I don't actually know of seeing anything like those trains before, but it really did have a certain dream deja-vu at the time.}]

{The man hastily pulled out some kind of adhesive and stuck it on my hand, as an angry-looking man approached me and tried to do something to me. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to show him the sticker so he'd leave me alone or hide the sticker.}

{Shortly thereafter I was laying in some kind of hospital room, and a woman walked by me.}

[woman: ("disgustedly") "You're a bad teacher."]

[me: {I'm not sure what you're referring to. What exactly is it you think that I don't teach well?}]

"Words appeared on a wall that I was looking at."

[wall: "She didn't say 'teacher', she said 'preacher'."]

{There was an elderly woman seated to my left and another woman sitting on my right. A woman in a nurse's outfit came with a needle, which I interpreted as a lethal injection. The woman to my right welcomed it and talked about how much she was looking forward to death, but the nurse didn't get to us.}

[nurse: "I've run out."]

{I still had the sticker on my fingers from before, and the old lady to my left snuck a tube up to me.}

[old-lady: "Stick your finger in here."]

{I followed her direction, which infuriated the nurse, who tackled me.}

[nurse: "You're not allowed to use the Aids-well!"]
