print {I was riding in a van with two men who were speaking to me. They looked like famous actors but ones I had a hard time pinning down. One of them looked like Dennis Hopper.}

dialog [

    me: "Who are you supposed to be?"

    dennis-hopper: <pointing> {He's the teacher from the Blue Lagoon. I'm from that movie with Ed McMahon. We're both movie characters, but the problem is you haven't SEEN the movies we're in. So I can't get you more information, as we can only communicate using symbols we both understand.}

note {Never saw or read [The Blue Lagoon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Lagoon_(novel)), but it has no particular "teacher". Fruitless searches for The Blue Lagoon and Ed McMahon interrupted various segments of this dream.}

dialog [

    dennis-hopper: {You shouldn't think of us as spirits or beings, who are using avatars of 'fictional' characters. We are the incarnations of the characters themselves, residing in the cosmos of ideas.}

    me: "Hmmm. I am not convinced."

print {We got out of the van, and a small man who looked like a paper cutout was walking along the sidewalk. I pointed at him.}

dialog [

    me: {Let's take that weird little paper cutout guy, for example. Everything I know about virtual reality suggests that these are best explained as animated avatars. It's not reasonable to believe a fictional idea can somehow 'incarnate' in a fully abstract manner and then interact with me.}

    dennis-hopper: {Why is it so hard for you to believe that when you are at a certain level, *things are only able to look like what they actually are*?}

print {This conversation was derailed when I touched something I apparently shouldn't have. Suddenly slug-looking started appearing whenever I touched something else. A woman wearing white came over to help--when I put my hand on her leg the slugs would transfer to her, and she'd neutralize them. Eventually they were all gone.}
