    {I was looking at a shiny modern-looking box that an Apple computer was shipping in. There was a suspicious area on the box which didn't look like it was part of the original printing. It didn't integrate into the box's overall design.}

    {The small part of the box was touting that the computer came with an emulator which let you run "IBM PC jr" software, along with 17 other operating systems.}

note {The [PC Jr.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PCjr) is a real, but somewhat obscure computer, that I doubt many people in this universe would be interested in emulating.}
