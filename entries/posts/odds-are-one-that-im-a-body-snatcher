{I was in some kind of community room where a talk was about to be given. The subject of the talk was dreams and their meaning. At first I sat in the first row, but then started to feel skeptical that the person speaking was going to say anything interesting.}

{Feeling like I had to go to the bathroom, I used that as a rationale for why I was getting up from the front row and walking out. As I did, I noticed the meeting room I was leaving was in a church.}

[me: ("thinking to myself") {Hmmm... a church. Well, maybe that means the bathrooms won't be completely disgusting. Hey, wait. This is a dream, which means the bathrooms probably WILL be disgusting. But still, I feel like I have to go...I wonder if I do if that will make the sensation stop, and if it does, if that means I'm wetting the bed?}]

{As the sensation was strong I went ahead and used the dream-toilet. The bathrooms were actually quite clean, which surprised me. When I left the bathroom I marched back into the room where the speaker was at the podium.}

[me: {All right, so you're having a dreaming workshop here. That's great and all, but I'm dreaming *right now*. Do you think you are as well? Not that we both have to be...perhaps I'm dreaming and you're not.}]

[speaker: "Well, I assure you this isn't a dream."]

[me: "I say it is."]

{The speaker pulled out a swiss-army style pocketknife, and smiled.}

[speaker: {Well, if this is a dream, then this knife can't hurt you--right?}]

[me: ("reaching for the knife") "Precisely. Give it to me and I'll show you."]

{This upset him, and he pulled the knife away...cautionarily waggling the blade before folding it back into the knife.}

[speaker: "Hey, this is seriously sharp."]

[me: "Well give it to me and let me check it out."]

[speaker: {Why would it make a difference if you cut yourself in a dream as opposed to me cutting you?}]

[me: {I'm sure *I'd* be fine, but lately I have been worrying about this whole mind-control and channeling thing lately. It's possible I'm just making some host-person babble and injure themselves, and maybe there's some feedback I'd get from what they'd be comfortable with, so I'd know when to stop.}]

{At this point the room disappeared and I was sort of talking to a view of mountains and static, yet I could hear a voice very clearly.}

[me: {Is it true? Is there a race of mind control creatures that take over human minds?}]

[voice: {Yes. But there are relatively few of them, compared to the number of humans.}]

[me: {Hmmm, wonder what the odds are that I'm a mind control being?}]

[voice: "One."]

[me: {I'm confused. You mean like... the odds are One Point Oh Oh, e.g. 100%?}]

[voice: "Yes. It is certain that is what you are."]
