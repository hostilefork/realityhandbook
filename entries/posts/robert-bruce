        {A friend had been telling me about Robert Bruce, who is a mystic of sorts who has written a couple of books. They were a little heavy on the terminology for me, but he seemed to be covering some of the same ground that I did. Strangely, when I looked up his website I saw he was advertising something that I had found one of on the ground in the middle of the road:}

        {I thought it was like... some sort of fancy label that came with a cell phone (it reminded me of how jackets sometimes have oversized plastic pendants bearing the brand of the manufacturer.) But it's called a "Q-link", costs $99 by mail order, and is supposed to help you channel energy. Unfortunately I threw it away at some point.}

        [update 1-Jan-2009 {I found it in a pocket of an old jacket that I was giving to Goodwill. Robert warned me to not wear "someone else's Q-link". But that doesn't make any more sense to me than when I couldn't feed my Mogwai after midnight--I mean, *time zones* make it impossible for that to make any difference. So I did wear it for a couple of days to see if there were any dream effects, and there were (unsurprisingly) not.)}]

        {In any case, he has a blog, and I left a comment on it...to which [he briefly replied](http://blog.astraldynamics.com/?p=3#comments). But here's a copy of the letter.}

    ]]

{Hello Mr. Bruce! Nice to see a metaphysics-based podcast...}

{I hadn't heard of you until recently, when a friend of mine repeatedly suggested I look at your books which she is reading. Touring your site I was rather surprised to see the "Q-Link" because I had found one of those pendants in a crosswalk in Los Angeles. Had no idea what it was at the time...I was thinking it was some kind of tag or label that had come on a cell phone and been discarded. I think I threw it away weeks later at the laundromat when I was emptying my pockets!}

{The reason my friend thought I should look into you is that for decades I have had surreal and atypical lucid dreaming experiences. Though in the beginning I thought modern scientific models of the brain would be able to explain it, I now feel it requires some kind of protoscientific/paranormal point of view to understand. Despite jumping into what many critical thinkers would pejoratively call "mysticism", I've tried to be very self-aware.}

{My desire is to not present myself as an authority but rather as a student of experience--and possibly a linchpin for greater understanding. Since you mentioned interest in paranormal research and developments in that area, I thought you might find my site worth a look. Rather than ask anyone meeting me to first read hundreds of dream documents, I've tried to put a little introduction together to explain the nature of my unique experience:}

{*(Hopefully I'm meeting your criteria of "is it true, is it kind, is it necessary"!)*}

{In any case, in your video introduction you mention this idea of seeing the layers and the ways in which we can see ourselves as "all one". Strangely this is a concept that has been preoccupying me the last few weeks, as a somewhat subliminal undercurrent in many pieces of art. I've wondered how to apply this as holding greater keys to decoding my experiences:}

{In any case, thank you for reading, and please feel free to write me at my email address or make any comments on the journal that interest you! *(It is possible to comment anonymously as well.)*}
