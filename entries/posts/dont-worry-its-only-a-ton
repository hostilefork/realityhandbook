print {I was in a strange factory, and trying to get some secret information from a friend.}

note {A skeptic of the idea that any connections between people exist in dreaming, he has challenged me to extract his high-school nickname out of a dream.}

dialog [friend: "stupid boy...goofball...it is along these lines"]

print << [

    {I tried to follow up with that some more but decided it wasn't really going anywhere, and his form had changed to some person I didn't recognize. Both he and I were wearing several name tags, and my own designated me as an "Administrator".}

    {Exploring the factory further, there were many computers and people doing weaving or other crafts. Encountering an attractive woman who was assembling something, I interrupted her.}

dialog [

    me: {Excuse me, I'm not really sure how to conduct myself here. What's considered to be unacceptable behavior in this environment?}

    woman: <depressed and woodenly> "It's not acceptable to enjoy f---ing."

note {As much as it bothers me to censor words here in the journal, I guess it might be wise to, but she was referring enjoying sex not being acceptable.}

dialog [me: {Well that doesn't sound like a very pleasant policy. Who says you're not allowed to enjoy that?}]

print {She took me to a window and pointed out a building that was called the Humbert House, which was where the oppressors lived. It had a Marquee up with some writing I couldn't read. As I tried to, a voice came over a loudspeaker.}

dialog [voice: "Okay, they're about to launch a 20,000 ton attack."]

print {Worried, I herded a group of people together near some computer terminals.}

dialog [

    me: "All right, everybody...we've got to get down."

    someone: {The announcement said *ton*, not *megaton*. We'll be fine. It's worth the risk, we get paid well.}

]

print {I noticed there were computer terminals and went on trying to look for a web browser. They gathered around me and twittered nervously.}

dialog [

    someone: {What are you DOING? Are you crazy? None of these computers are even *connected*.}

    me: "Where can I find a 'connected' computer."

    someone: {The one on your desk is connected, but...what are you doing here in the first place? They monitor *everything*.}
