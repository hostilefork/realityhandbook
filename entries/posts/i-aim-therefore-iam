print {I was speaking over instant messenger on the topic of how some people are completely obsessed with internet messenger, as if their identity was tied up with it. This led me to type out the sentence I AIM, therefore I am. Looking at it, I went back and modified it into I AIM, therefore IAM ! before sending it... and as I realized it was a dream I was pretty impressed at the persistence the screen had to allow me to type that modification.}
