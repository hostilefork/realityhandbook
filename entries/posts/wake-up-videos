print {I was discussing code for some reason with people and numerics.}

dialog [
    me: "...so it's like Jewel, with the 0304 thing.  Jewel Kilcher."

print {The guy in front of me made a gagging gesture pointing at his mouth, signaling disapproval of her and/or her music.}

dialog [
    me: "Well, I wouldn't call her my favorite musician.  But she's pretty good still...and I think she's attractive.  I'm just telling you that for calibration purposes--and the video Stand is good, and she looks quite good in that...or Intuition, also."

    man: "But the album is...pretty much a non-sequitur and kind of blatant, isn't it?"

    me: "Maybe.  But I'm pretty sure it holds up in my reality...as in, I'm basically sure that person--whom I've seen in concert--can be traced to it.  So do they take over her mind, or like, what?  How did that album get made?"

    man: "You're asking me why OSCOS chose that as a response?  We don't know.  When you do something, then things move.  That's what you got back from something you did--it's how it works."

    me: "What's an...OSCOS?"

    man: "They're who you should watch out for, and there's one right there."

print {A man came up to me and poked me, fighting me until I was awakened in a new situation.  I was naked and carrying a bag.  It split into two bags which I used to cover my front and rear, as I walked through a store.  Someone approached me, and led me to a table in a restaurant.}

dialog [
    stranger: "You're not safe in here, come this way."

    me: "Okay, this is just miserable.  What can you all do to get me out of here?  There's been a lot of coordination and things happening in my life with things zipping around but it never gets anywhere.  Can I get out?"

print {Without an awareness of why I was doing it, I began writing down the ingredients for the four breakfast specials on the menu.  Two were kind of greasier looking, and I was trying to choose between the others.  I didn't exactly realize why I was copying down the ingredients instead of ordering.  A waiter confronted me.}

dialog [
    waiter: "It's been a long time since we've seen you here!  your ex girlfriend, she's been by here a lot.  I think she would like to see you."

    me: "I think you probably have me confused with someone else..."

    waiter: "No no, and a good time to meet with her; maybe around Christmas time, everyone visits family at Christmas."

    me: <sighing> "I'll meet anyone, I guess."

print << [
    {A man handed me two bills, a $5 and a $1.  Someone else came in and he wanted me to give the money to him...while he started filling out a form related to meeting the girl mentioned earlier.}

    {I realized I hadn't paid for my restaurant bill.}
]

dialog [
    me: <to waiter> "Did I pay yet?  You should run my card..."

    waiter: "Sure, you can pay but...but we have to...change the words on the order.  So, hold on."
]

print {He and a group of other people gathered together in some kind of trance, bumping up against each other.  The waiter called to the cashier.}

dialog [
    waiter: "Change it to say...pineapple?"

print << [
    {It began to be that there were a lot of people in the building, and I would try walking various ways.  Some would block me, some would make it so I would wind and walk around them.}

    {I found myself being corralled...and there were giant trucks and crowds of things, vehicles with GOOGLE printed on them.  People were shouting names, including "Brian", Jesus, etc.}

    {It went out of control and I looked at it.  A girl came wandering out into the middle of it, looking bewildered.  She walked toward me and I hugged her.  Another shorter girl walked toward us and I included her in a group hug, kissing them on the head.}
]

dialog [
    me: "It goes like this for me all the time, but I'd be happier to not be alone while it happens.  This is the biggest event I've seen yet."
]

print {A man walked up and joined us.}

dialog [
    man: "Yeah, this is pretty epic.  It's like from our wake-up videos.  You make a comic of something like this happening, and then people see it and think 'wait a minute, it could actually work like that'."

    me: "I've never seen a cartoon or movie of this.  Would be interesting if I could figure out how to communicate it."
