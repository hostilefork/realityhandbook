{I was in a room with several people and listening to a conversation. A white-haired man stopped and took notice of me.}

[man: <pointing at me> "Don't say anything else. Kill him. Now."]

[me: <sneering> {You'll be easy to recognize. You look like that guy who played the billionaire in the SNL bailout sketch.}]

[note {I was referring to the impersonation of George Soros:} [picture %soros_impersonator_from_snl.png] {...though I thought it was Carl Icahn for some reason.}]

{As someone came up and injected me, I held my gaze on a piece of paper. It was some sort of shipping invoice or advertisement for the HO BAN FRUIT COMPANY. Though the name sounded Asian, it was listed as being located in Massachusetts.}

[note {Although I read the text rather clearly as Massachusetts, a voice or impression in my head said "Iraq".}]

{Feeling an urgency to write down this information, I jumped out of bed and looked around. Though things were relatively solid in my apartment, a few things seemed off. I realized I hadn't woken up yet, so I ran into the hallway and into my neighbor's apartment. Some people I didn't know were there.}

[me: {Okay there are these really bad people... um, something about the Ho Ban Fruit Company, you've got to write this down somewhere.}]

{When I mentioned Ho Ban, there was a loud noise of machinery outside. A girl seated at a table looked at me resignedly.}

[girl: "Well, that's that I guess, now we're *all* dead."]
