    {In some circumstance I was confronting a guy about the ills of my waking world, and how Trump had been elected president, and that it was essentially all just spam.}

    man: <laughing> {I think it's funny.  It gets funnier...in this one, we've got Jeb Bush as president, and David Duke as vice president.}

He was never taken seriously in the political realm, and it troubled many people that he endorsed Donald Trump who [did not disavow that endorsement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/03/01/donald-trump-and-david-duke-for-the-record/?utm_term=.a7e1a3407f00).}
