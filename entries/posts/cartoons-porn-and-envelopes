{I was watching several nonexistent Homestar Runner cartoons, and other rather peculiar Flash animations. The URLs were things like "http://homestarrunner.com/painting/a".}

[note {I have in the past been semi-convinced that Homestar Runner is produced using software that is not available to the average consumer, and that their generosity in giving it away for free may be a by-product of some kind of "alien" scheme.}]

{As I looked around the room, I noticed there were a lot of pornographic videos laying around. Some of it was "toon porn" and some was just "ordinary porn". I overheard some people talking, but I couldn't see them.}

[voice-one: {It's like, yeah...if I knew I were going to die in just a few minutes, I'd want to spend the last moments of life doing it...just like in this video.}]

[voice-two: {Be realistic. Wouldn't you have something more important to take care of?}]

[voice-one: {No man, I'd grab whoever I could find and get naked as quickly as possible.}]

{I walked around a kitchen, looking for a piece of mail. My idea was to find out a name and an address. When I found one, at first it looked like "George" and it flickered a bit as I looked at it repeatedly, sometimes saying "Georgio". Last name looked like "Tivomoretto".}

{A woman in the kitchen was standing there, looking at me silently.}

[me: "Hey, can you tell me what this name says?"]

{She didn't answer, so I hit her in the nose with the envelope to get her attention.}

[woman: ("annoyed") "What does it matter what the name means?"]

[me: {I'm not asking what the name <i>means</i>, I asked what the letters are.}]

"She grabbed my arm in a painful way and I awoke."
