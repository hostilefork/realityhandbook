print {I had a dream where a polar bear froze to death, and left behind two cubs.}

print {I suggested we name them "P.B." (for Polar Bear) and "Jay", so they'd be PB & J}

note [
    print {This was kind of funny, so I'd woken myself up enough to make a small note about it...without taking down more details of the dream in which we'd found the cubs.  Unsurprisingly, out on the Internets, there is a cartoon book about a [P.B. and Jay](https://www.amazon.com/P-B-Sandwich-Islands-Michael-Pierce/dp/0991233212) where "P.B." stands for Polar Bear, but Jay is a penguin.  That is not a particularly realistic duo--as I imagine in reality, the polar bear would eat the penguin.}

    print {A few other times I've taken such small notes on dream things that make me laugh, with little other details.  One note was from 5-Jul-2017 and was about an advertisement I saw which said *"Try our New and Improved Circular Fluid Absorbers!  They don't absorb any more fluid--but they're more circular."*  It's the kind of thing that I can catch myself laughing at in my sleep.}

    print {That "fluid absorber" dream I had a note about something else I was reading which was the "Fifteen dollar change outlet.  We'll make change for no charge.  Just bring us $20 and we'll give you 3 five dollar bills."  Which isn't that funny, as it's very much like other change-making jokes.  Though it does have a slightly different spin on it...in the sense that it's saying they perform the given task "at no charge".}
