    me: "What frequency is this being broadcast on?"

    guy: "Huh?"

    me: {This show, how is it getting here? What kind of technology? Is this a television?}

    guy: "I don't understand your question."

    me: {The signal has to get here somehow, and I want to know how. Is it packet-based?}

    guy: "It's 1099.E.E, dude."

print {I believed the information I was looking at was related to inter-dimensional communication. It was describing a man who had "seen q", and invented something called *Channel Satellite Radio*. I tried to read the Channel Satellite Radio article, but somehow ended up at an article on Christmas trees instead.}
