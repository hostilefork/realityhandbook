print {I was in an old-school store that was packed with products, and the sales ladies were older women. It was something like a Walgreens, though there was a real red-theme going on with the interior. They were having a conversation about what conglomerate owned their store as well as Ralph's, and I want to say it was something like "Greenway".}

dialog [me: {It will be interesting to see who owns the chain. I'll check it out when I wake up.}]

print {There was a deli counter of some sort and I sat down at it. Another older woman was sitting there, I tried writing my name on a piece of paper for her. She and someone else looked at it.}

dialog [them: "You've written all numerics."]

print {I tried sounding my name out in halting phonetics, and they seemed to pick it up...repeating it to me all as one word.}

dialog [

    old-lady: {Did you meet the angel of light? She was looking for you.}

    me: {I haven't. I'd be surprised if anyone could find anyone in this madhouse.}

    old-lady: {This body I'm in just has so many limitations, I can't stand it.}

    me: {I'm not used to treating bodies like cars and jumping from one into another.}

print {She got up to go into the bathroom and seemed to change into a much younger woman as she did.}
