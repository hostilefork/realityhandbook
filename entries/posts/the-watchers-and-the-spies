{I like to report my appearances in the dreams of others, when they choose to mention them. A friend said she dreamed about me explaining to her that I do not carry a phone because I am followed by "watchers" everywhere I go. I keep a low profile and most of my friends are in "Pinebury" (sp?) and London, who I've gathered from around the world.}

{There was also something about different magnet schools for the arts. We were going over conversation logs together and she was noticing that she was patronizing and that I was defensive. This dream was on Sept 11th.}
