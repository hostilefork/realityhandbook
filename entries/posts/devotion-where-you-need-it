{I was in my grandmother's house, speaking to my deceased grandfather who was sitting in a chair. Quite aware that it was a dream, I wanted to do some checks...asking him what his name was, testing other things. After inquiring about who he was, and he answered (after a delay) with my grandfather's name, he began questioning me.}

[grandfather: "Who do you think YOU are?"]

[me: "I'm not sure."]

[grandfather: "You are a writer, and I am your *other writer*."]

{I asked some questions about what would happen if I died in the physical world. There were insinuations that in the afterlife one needs to be repaired and get medical treatment. I also began asking questions about whether there was any way to direct communications so we could talk again. I even began to get kind of sarcastic.}

[me: {Is there any way to communicate with you as I know no guided way of returning to this place? I mean, is there a particular channel on TV I should watch? Or look for messages in sea foam? I'm not saying I'll actually look, but I'm just asking...because this is not a very verifiable way of talking.}]

"A woman in the room offered a suggestion."

[woman: {There is one way. Repeat this phrase: *devotion where you need it*, *devotion where you need it*, *devotion where you need it*...}]

{I started to repeat the words. She kept repeating it as well, and would substitute a single word in each repetition of the phrase. A little later I got distracted, and asked to have the phrase repeated; but the room was becoming crowded with a parade of young people. When I asked what the phrase was again, someone quipped: "Inspirational teenage meeting".}

{Shortly thereafter I remembered what the phrase really was. Thus I decided to wake up and write it down.}
