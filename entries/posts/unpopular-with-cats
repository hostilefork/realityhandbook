{I was looking at a pile of old broken things--including a TV--in the living room of the house of one of my grandparents. Walking into an adjoining room, I began to collect pins and nails that I had seen on the floor. They'd been hurting me and I decided to contain them into a little plastic container.}

{When I returned to the room, things had been rearranged--and there was a newly sealed box for the TV. I looked at it, and my (deceased) grandfather was sitting in a recliner looking at it. Feeling emotional, I teared up a bit.}

[me: {It's just sad. I guess there was a time when you bought a new TV and it was exciting, before the stroke and when all you could do was flip through channels.}]

[grandfather: {Well these things happen. And it hasn't turned out to be all bad. Why--morris here just turned 20.}]

{It seemed like a fairly normal cat, but its teeth were somewhat awry. I reached out my hand to pet it, but it moved away, and spoke.}

[cat: "No."]

[note {Morris might not have been the name of the cat and it might have been another age. Also these grandparents always had dogs, so its weird there'd be a cat on that sofa.}]

[me: {Ok, another example right there. Cats can't talk. People can't talk to the dead. So what's going on?}]

[grandfather: {I'll see that we do more to get hammer out... the, uh...}]

[me: "The mechanics of these interactions."]

[grandfather: {Yes. We'll see what we can do. And also, see what we can do to get square on why you and I are unique in this.}]

[me: {I think the question is: Why is everyone else *not* square about this. It leads me to wonder what's gone wrong. What's being hidden, and for what purpose?}]

{The grandfather figure seemed to transform into a big grey cat/rat thing and looked at me closely, bringing its face right up to mine.}

[big-cat: ("scornfully") "Hateful."]

[me: "Yes, I have been."]

[note "Have been trying to work on that."]
