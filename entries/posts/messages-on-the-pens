{There were some pens which had messages on them. I thought I had woken up and was still holding these pens. Though I knew a pen couldn't prove anything about dream communication, I wanted to contact the manufacturer and see who had ordered these messages to be printed.}

{Unfortunately, someone was chasing me and trying to get the pens back. So I got the idea to start hiding them places where I would find them later. After hiding most of the pens with a friend, I got down to one and each hand but I couldn't see my hands any longer.}

[me: "Can you verbally describe what is in my hands?"]

[friend: <irate> {You have a red coin in your right hand, and a pencil in your left hand.}]

[me: "Is the pencil in my left hand *yellow*??"]

{The question further angered whoever I was asking. Then a guy was trying to run over me with a small car or cart...and I realized I was dreaming and stopped running. Instead I walked up to him, introduced myself, and asked him his name.}

[driver: "I am Franzie, from Quebec."]

{Following on that lucidity I started speaking with someone else, and asked about the place were we were. He said his name was "De Cortes"}

[note {He very distinctly did not say De Cortez or Decartes.}]
