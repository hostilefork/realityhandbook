print {After talking for a while to some woman with a small dog at a bank about how she couldn't clear a check, I found myself hooked onto some kind of "video game treadmill" branded by a company called GABER.}

note [
    print {Several companies appear to use the name GABER, ranging from oil companies to jewelry.  The only real "electronics" company seems to be in Egypt.}

    "I was running on the treadmill seeing the screen, and feeling winded and panicked about the game.  The image I saw switched from being running on the treadmill to seeing some kind of electric equipped vehicles which were designed to go out and electrify roads to assassinate people.  It was a dark Tron-Legacy type look."

    "When I watched from a sort of aerial view the building from which the vehicle swarm was spreading out, I saw writing on a tower that looked like it was going to form the word FIBERGLASS but mutated into GABER."

    "Seeing a spark strike a felt a shooting pain in my spine and blacked out to just switching to listening to a Depeche Mode song titled *Smooth*.  I strained to listen to the lyrics, knowing it was a dream and that this was not a song from the world I knew."

    "At first the lyrics were disappointing and just said 'look at the moon so white, so white, so white...'.  But then they switched to something more musical:"

        "Can't you see what's going on now?"

    {At a certain point, I woke up in the back seat of a car, with light blue or white fabric.  There was a pen nearby, and I started to write the lyrics onto the car seat...then thought better of it and looked for paper.}

    {While looking I felt like someone was outside.  I got up and saw there was a young man in a U.S. military outfit.}

dialog [
    me: <exiting car> "Hi there, my name is Brian."
]

print {He was puzzled and asked me wasn't my name something else, which was a female name.  Looking at myself I realized that I appeared to be inhabiting a female body, Quantum-Leap style.}

dialog [
    me: "Ah, well there's just this guy I'm in love with."

    military-guy: "What's his name?"

    me: <laughing> "Well, Brian, obviously."

    military-guy: "My battalion is 1000 soldiers in size, and I need an audience personally with the commanding officer.  Can you arrange a meeting?"

print "I realized we were outside of some kind of military building on a base."

dialog [
    me: "Um, sure...I'll see what I can do?"

print "I deduced I was some sort of secretary or otherwise at this military office, and I'd been napping in the parking lot for some reason.  I didn't say I could help him or not, just kind of stumbled off into work to try to figure it out and awoke."
