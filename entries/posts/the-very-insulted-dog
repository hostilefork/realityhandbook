{I was wandering around various houses, on accident... seemingly walking in on people.  They didn't seem to get angry, so I tried talking to everyone I saw.}

[me: {Excuse me, can anyone talk, maybe answer some questions?}]

{Everyone I addressed made excuses for why they did not have time, and I noticed even the animals seemed to speak about being too busy.  I went outside and saw a little dog sitting on the ground.}

[me: "Excuse me, can you... speak?"]

[dog: ("mouth moving like a movie effect") "Yes."]

[me: {Oh.  All right.  That's unusual where I'm from.  Dogs can't speak.}]

"He looked puzzled."

[me: {Well, maybe we're not seeing things the same way.  If you don't mind some contact... this is your left ear.  It feels fuzzy.  This is your right ear, also fuzzy.}]

{As I touched him, he got closer.  His nose got very close and touched my face.}

[me: {Okay that's your nose.  Wet, not fuzzy.  Dogs use them for smelling.  But you're a little too close, you might wake me up.}]

{The dog and I sort of had an awkward moment as his paws went up to my hands and he started to morph into someone looking a bit like a Mexican migrant worker.  We swayed forward and back until he disengaged.  He became very angry, as he stood on his feet a short distance away.}

[mexican: {This 'dog' of yours?!?  <i>That</i> is how they've translated it?  This is all from a history of discrimination against my people.}]

[note {I don't know if the people he referred to were Mexican migrant workers, or if it was merely another step in 'translation' to me for the status of his disenfranchised group--whatever it was.}]
