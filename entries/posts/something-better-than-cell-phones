{I was on a bed with some men and women and talking. At one point something one of the guys had said alerted me that it was a dream.}

[me: {Can you show me anything cool? I can show you something interesting...}]

{I somehow conjured a TabletPC out of thin air and started demonstrating it for him.}

[him: {Oh that's from back when they used cell phones, before they found out something better.}]

[me: {Really? What's better than cell phones, can you explain it?}]

{The next thing I knew I was looking at some kind of animated chemical diagram. The first thing that stood out to me was a chain of "W+" and "W-" objects.}

[note {Though I first assumed this had to do with Tungsten atoms, an article on Slashdot today was published about [The Science Behind Buckaroo Banzai](http://www.geekazon.com/banzai/index.html). While reading it I was very surprised to see it mention that the notation for "intermediate vector bosons" are W+, W-, and Zo. I didn't search on that, I just happened across it the day following this dream!}]

{I tried to look closer and ask questions. A scientist in a labcoat came in the room, he seemed nice.}

[scientist: "I can explain more of this if you want."]

[me: "That would be helpful!"]

{He took me to a room filled with scientific instruments, where two angry women came in and attacked me. This woke me up.}
