print {I was doing some amount of yardwork with a friend.  I understood we were trying to get things done before taking a trip.  One of the things involved dealing with a sort of fire ant infestation--trying to get them killed.}

    me: {Darn ants.  Well, at least I have insurance now.}

    friend: {I remember the first time I got insurance.  Once you have it--you feel invincible...you're on top of the world.  We call this feeling "The Thrust".}

print {I changed my shoes and pants, and we went to get something to eat.  The place we chose had a stainless-stell exterior, and it was called "Frombo".  I recall that inside, it had pictures of desserts painted on the ceiling.}

note {This is a good example of a short dream I bother to take notes down about, because it is so specific.  Curiously there aren't any restaurants named "Frombo" (seems like a good name for one, doesn't it?)  But oddly enough the site `frombo.com` is for an architect, and as I thought the restaurant was architecturally notable, that's a bit interesting.}
