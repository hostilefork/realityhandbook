print {I had a laptop and was watching some kind of bizarre movie called "It's My Party" with someone.}

dialog [

    someone: {Oh yes, this is a good one. It stars Ann Taylor, and was produced by Richard Butler.}

    me: {Okay, thanks. I'll look this up on IMDB and see if it actually exists.}

note {I knew that looking it up on the dream laptop would NOT be the same as looking it up on my real laptop when I woke up, but decided it could be interesting anyway.}

    {Though I did bring up a web browser, a bouncing "new email" icon distracted me, and I switched to Apple Mail. There was a [Nerve Personals](http://www.nerve.com/login/LaunchPad.asp) notification, and some stuff that looked like spam.}

    {The email that interested me most was titled "Subject: Fourth". It had what appeared to be a Doonesbury cartoon attached. Looking closely at the "To:" address I tried to piece out what the recipient of all this mail was, and it came out as something along the lines of A.Chang@ILikeAsiaImportCandies.com.}
