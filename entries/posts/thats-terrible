{I was able to exercise some amount of control over my dreams, and it was impressive given the number of attractive women I was with. One conversation caught my attenion.}

[me: ("affectionately") "I don't know if I deserve this."]

[note {What I meant was that she was pretty, and I hadn't really done anything to warrant intimacy, as I had sorta just materialized there.}]

{She stopped moving and laid down on me. I continued.}

[me: {Well, sometimes I feel like I do deserve it. But sometimes I don't. I've been questioning myself a lot lately.}]

[her: "That's terrible."]

[note {I interpreted it as a response to my self-doubt, as opposed to a commentary on my dream-based love-making technique. Could be wrong.}]
