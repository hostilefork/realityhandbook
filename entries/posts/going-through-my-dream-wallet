{I was walking around in a building, and as I came to lucidity I decided I wanted to leave the building and go outside.  There was a sense I had that there was a door around the corner, but when I turned to go out it I found myself facing an up and a down escalator.}

[me: <to passerby> "Okay, that's strange.  I thought there was a door here."]

{A man stopped and shrugged at me.  I looked more closely and my field of view widened a bit so I could sort of see "behind" the escalators.  There was an "emergency exit: alarm will sound" sign on a door.}

[me: "I'd consider inhabiting a dream body in a parallel dimension to be an emergency.  Sorry if this bothers people."]

{I opened the door and an alarm went off.  It was dark outside, and there was a little cement driveway with a van parked with its back toward the emergency exit.  The area was gated and I was fenced in.  With some difficulty I managed to climb over a wall and into an alley.}

{Wanting to get away from the alarm situation, I went down a couple of streets and arrived at some kind of bar with a bouncer.  I wasn't sure if he was going to let me in, but he opened the door and motioned me to a free table to sit at.  The tables were numbered and I sat at an empty one that said "6".  A thin Asian man sat across from me.}

{I picked up one of the drink menus and turned to a girl sitting at the adjacent table who was looking at me.}

[me: {I'm still very curious about the physics of this.  How can a spirit be connected with a body?  What's the mechanism of how I got here?}]

[girl: {That's not a question I know the answer to.}]

{When I turned back to my table, it was now filled up.  There was a precise-looking man with glasses and a notebook.  Looking to the drink menu I saw the prices seemed to be about $7 for a drink.  I pulled out my wallet to look at it.}

[me: {Okay, let's see.  Dream wallet, check.  Hopefully there's enough in here to pay for a drink.}]

{The guy with glasses looked over my shoulder as I asked him questions about what was in the wallet.  One was a credit-card sized device that had markings on it seeming to suggest it contained electronics, and the lines were outlining where the different parts were *(battery, transmitters, etc.)*}

[me: <holding up the card> {What's this for?}]

[glasses-guy: {It's a sort of universal key.  You use it as an ID, it starts your car.}]

[me: {No pictures.  Hmmm.  Guess I can't figure out who I am from that.}]

{I pulled out something that was also the size of a credit card, but looked like some sort of sheath; where you would slot things into it instead of slotting it into other things.}

[me: {And what's this?}]

[glasses-guy: <laughing> {That is the greatest universal standard for credit cards ever.  No I am joking, that is very non-standard.  I don't know why it's like that.  But the marking on it is for a credit agency.}]

{As I turned the item around in my hands I noticed something odd about the tips of my fingers.  They had small reverse-video prints of black numbers on them, and some circuit-looking things.  As I focused on my hands they no longer looked like flesh but started to cross over into looking white and robotic.}

[me: {Hm.  Okay, I am a robot, apparently.  Well, whatever.  Say... as long as we're talking couldn't we exchange some kind of information?  I mean, I can tell you about things we have... even simple things.  You can tell me if you have them or not.  How about LEGO, do you know what that is?}]

[glasses-guy: {No...}]

[me: {Well give me that pad and a pen, I can draw some stuff up for you.}]

{I took his notebook and found a blank page, and began to write on it.  As I wrote on it I noticed the page filling up behind what I was writing.  Frustrated, I kept turning pages and finding blank areas where information would start scribbling under me and seemingly sliding out from where other writing was.}

[me: {Okay, I don't know if your notebook is scribbling on itself...or if I'm unable to find a blank page and only perceiving it to be blank.  Why don't you find a blank page for me?}]

{He took the notebook and flipped through it and shrugged about the fact that he didn't have any blank pages.}
