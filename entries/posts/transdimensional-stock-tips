{A dream last night from what people were claiming was 2024 led me to poke on the web for "best stocks of 2004/2005". Typing didn't work so well, but when I conveyed that abstract idea, I got a chart of Jack Daniels stock, images of Whiskey and a side story and all that. It showed a little graph over time and it jumping from 60 to 90.}

[note 11-Jun-2008 {I didn't even know Jack Daniels *had* stock, but <a href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=BF.B&time=5yr">they do</a>, and it would have been a decent investment to have made in 2004.)}]
