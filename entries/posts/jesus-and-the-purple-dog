{In a non-lucid dream I was at a table and doing some painting on brick work, to make the bricks colorful.}

[note {I would not paint brick in real life.  I hate it when people do that.}]

{A man who I perceived to be an atheist/objectivist/libertarian skeptic addressed me.}

[skeptic: <dismissively> {So what's your take on this whole "Jesus" thing?}]

[me: {Jesus?  Hm.  Well if you'd asked me about it when I was younger, I would have told you I don't believe in God...much less the idea of that God personified and walking around Earth to talk to you.  But how can I put it, let's say someone tells you about a purple dog.  And the person you're telling has never seen a dog before.  But here you are, telling them a purple dog exists.}]

[skeptic: {Wait, hold on.  So have they seen any dogs at all before?}]

[me: {My point is that you will get some different reactions.  You might find people who've never seen a dog before being more willing to believe you saw a purple dog than those who've seen dogs and are certain they know you didn't see a purple one.  Or someone will tell you that what you *really* saw was probably some lighter color dog that was dyed purple.  Even a darker colored dog that was bleached and then dyed purple.  Oddly enough: *the more someone knows about dogs* the more certain they will be that you didn't see an actual purple dog.  Which is a little bit of a paradox; because they've learned the difference between knowing and not-knowing; yet aren't open to the idea of possibilities they don't see yet.}]

[skeptic: <frustrated> {That doesn't answer the question.  Jesus or no?}]

[me: {It could happen.  Sure.  Why do you ask?}]
