{I was in a situation where I was romantically involved with a girl that I know. We were walking to a concert.}

[me: {What is the significance of us making out in this dream.}]

[her: {Really, it's just simple mind-reading. We're going to eventually, why not now?}]

[me: "Where is your boyfriend?"]

[her: {He's with a pretty cool girl right now, who I really like too. She works on marketing and distribution for Chips Ahoy.}]

[note {[Chips Ahoy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chips_Ahoy%21) is a brand of pre-packaged cookies.}]

{By now she had morphed into someone else, and we were walking through a shopping mall.}

[her: "I see this long list of nears on your forehead."]

[me: "Nears?"]

[her: "Nears."]

[me: "Wait, you mean N-E-A-R-S?"]

[her: "No, N-E-R-A-S."]

[me: "Can you explain what the heck those are?"]

[her: {I think we're going to have to introduce you to someone who can work that out.}]

[note {Cursory research on the foreign word root "nera" suggests it relates to "impatience".}]

{She led me through the crowded mall, which had noisy music playing. I thought the music was going to wake me up... to stay in the dream I started singing my own lyrics to it, it was an unfamiliar song.}

{We wound up in a dark room with a gathering of people kneeling in a circle, all wearing black jackets and leather gloves, surrounding a leader. I went to gather a jacket and a pair of gloves that was on the floor, which I somehow recognized as my own. One guy pointed at me and spoke in a stern tone.}

[him: "What are those, legs?!"]

[me: "Yes, I... I need to put on my jacket."]

[him: "Well the man doesn't like it."]

[note {The implication I took was that it was a problem that I was still standing, and needed to kneel in the circle around the leader.}]

{Once I'd knelt in the circle, the girl who had accompanied me to the room made a declaration.}

[her: "Sheila's not coming back."]

[someone: "Why not?"]

"The leader pointed at me."

[leader: {This man *is* the military. And one of the nicest people around. If he had to make a decision, then it was probably the right one.}]

[note {I guess there was an accusation that I'd been responsible either directly or indirectly for Sheila's death.}]
