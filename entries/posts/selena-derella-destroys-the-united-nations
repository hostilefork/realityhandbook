[{I was working with a computer system, that was all about management of licensing of elements for creating a cartoon television show. That it held up to inspection pleased me.}]
[note {It was a large database like IMDB...it was very obsessive about copyrights. If you used a voice generator, such as if you wanted Bugs Bunny to say a certain sentence, you'd be automatically adding an attribution in your cartoon to say "character's voice appears courtesy of..." and then some big studio conglomerate.}]
[{Somehow I loaded up a web browser and opened my email account. It was full of what looked like spam messages, and I looked at the system clock and it was 6/2004. Someone at a nearby terminal looked on.}]
[me: {Y'know, when I went to bed, it was August 2005. Is there anything you can tell me about this deviation in time?}]
[guy: ("stiltedly") {When...they build...a clock to hang...on the wall...they don't make it out of pepperoni. They make it...out of...<i>touch paper</i>.}]
[note {That sounds fairly nonsensical, but I understood this as saying that the world is made out of elements that are more complex than you think. So for instance, you might buy a poster at a store and believe it can only show the image it had when you purchased it...yet secretly it might be an advanced technology like an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_light-emitting_diode">Organic Light-Emitting Diode</a>...thus it could change at any point at time}]
[me: {Okay, that didn't make much sense. If time is not absolute, can you tell me anything about the future?}]
[second-guy: "An ex-cuban destroys the U.N. in four years time."]
[me: {What letter does their name start with? Is there any hope of verifying their existence?}]
[second-guy: {You have not heard of this person. The name is Selena Derella.}]
[me: "Okay, is that a man's name or a woman's name?"]
["I didn't get an answer before waking up."]
