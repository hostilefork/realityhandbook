{I was reading an XKCD-like comic that was about two scientists who had contacted aliens from another dimension.}

[scientist-one: "This is great, the prospects are phenomenal!"]

[scientist-two: "Yes, now let's send them a pop song I wrote."]

[scientist-one: {What?! We've just gotten agreements on physics, atoms, and laid the foundations for communicating!}]

[scientist-two: {That's exactly why we ABSOLUTELY have to send the song now!}]
