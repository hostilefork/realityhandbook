    {A female friend of mine from several years ago was seated in a chair and talking to me.  I was wearing boxer shorts and a long-sleeve shirt.  I was doing some kind of art project or organizing things, sitting on the floor.}

    {I didn't take too much alarm at being in my boxer shorts.  But when I heard from outside that my mother was coming up the stairs I went and closed the door to the room.  I began to look around the room for my pants, but then noticed that I was now completely naked.  The friend recoiled in the chair and looked at my crotch, and made a face.}

dialog [

    friend: {Jeez.  Now here with you here I'm getting several nut shows in one night.}

    me: <annoyed> {I was more or less dressed just moments ago.  I was only going to get some pants to put over boxer shorts.  And now I'm naked just from standing up.  That, along with talking to you, makes this a dream.  Funny I didn't pick up on that earlier.}

print {She got up from the chair and moved over to lay down on a narrow bed and looked at me.}

dialog [

    friend: "Well, yeah.  So?"

    me: {So?  So...what's the *point* of this?  Some kind of psychological exploration, about my fear of nudity?  For your information, I'm not scared of nudity when I'm awake...and I certainly shouldn't be scared of it in dreams.  That's like being afraid because it's the final exam and you didn't study, but you haven't been in school for decades.  Irrational.}

print "I approached the bed where she was laying."

dialog [me: {I mean, isn't there enough to worry about without this dream stuff being explained?  Why should I have to be cautious?  I'm in the right, here.  Let's say I wanted to do something sexual to you.}]

print {I partially pulled off her clothes and started stroking her body.}

dialog [

    me: {You gotta problem with THAT, figment of my imagination?!}

    her: {No, I don't.  But if you could do anything, I bet you'd prefer something more like this...}

    {A more attractive woman walked into the room, from a closet or other door I hadn't seen.  She stripped seductively in front of us, and showed off her body.  Then she climbed onto the bed with us, and began to perform oral sex on me.}

    {My friend was still on the bed and my head was laying in her lap.  I signaled for her to lean in to kiss me, although I had kind of a bad taste in my mouth.  She leaned in and sniffed my breath, and backed off.}

]

dialog [friend: {Bleah.  I'm not kissing you unless you use some mouthwash or something.}]

print {I awoke, and actually did have a bad taste in my mouth.}
