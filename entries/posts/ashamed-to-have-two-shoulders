print {I had a dream where I was rambling in a semi-nonsensical nature to a male friend. He hugged me.}

dialog [friend: "I don't want to lose you."]

print << [

    {Becoming lucid of the dream environment, I headed down a hallway. Though the hallway seemed institutional, the rooms I was looking into seemed fairly normal bedrooms with non-hospital decor. No one was in the beds.}

    {The first room I found looked like an office, and there was a guy who looked kind of doctor-ish inside.}

]

dialog [me: "Excuse me, is this a hospital?"]

print {He looked at me as if I had asked him a dumb question, and I asked him dumb questions all the time.}

dialog [doctor: <irked> "I don't have time, Richie. I'm busy."]

note {I noticed that the more I looked at him directly in the eyes, the closer I was to waking up. So I had to keep my glance averted.}

print {Walking in circles, I tried to focus and de-escalate any conflict...while still getting more information.}

dialog [

    me: {I'm sorry to ask stupid questions. It's just that I'm having some problems with my memory right now. Please...if you could answer...it would really help me.}

    doctor: <relaxing> {Yes. This is a hospital. It is a place to get over your addictions.}

    me: "How many patients are being treated here?"

    doctor: "There are 40 on this floor."

    me: "Is my presence here voluntary or involuntary?"

    doctor: {It is voluntary, but you have been here for five years.}

    me: {If I've been here for five years, I must have some serious problem not being solved. What is it?}

    doctor: "Your main problem is that you hear voices."

    me: {Oh. Voices is it? Ah, well, I suppose that would make sense.}

]

note {This struck me as humorous, because of course in this scenario--I'd be the voice! Having some sympathy for Richie, I decided not to leave my transdimensional calling card so he wouldn't appear any crazier than he already might.}

dialog [me: {Well I think I'm feeling a bit better about those voices these days. Thanks for all the information.}]

print {Then I walked out of the room. A few people passed me in the hall, including a girl who saw me and ran up to me.}

dialog [girl: "Are you ashamed to have two shoulders?"]

print {Confused, I just sort of paused until I noticed that she was missing an arm.}

dialog [

    me: <hedging> "Ummm...uh...yes?"

    girl: <enthusiastic> "Well I'm not!!!"

]

print {I picked her up in a playful manner and awoke shortly thereafter.}
