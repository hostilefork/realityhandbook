{I was chatting with someone when I realized I was dreaming. I couldn't see or perceive much, so I began asking questions about where I was. The voice had a heavy accent, perhaps Indian. (India-Indian, not Native American).}

[voice: {I don't know where you are. But I know you have a condo in Fufinda.}]

[me: "What country is Fufinda in?"]

[voice: "I don't know."]

[me: "What do you think my name is?"]

[voice: {I don't know your name, I only know your user ID, which is goat lick.}]

[me: "Huh?!? goat lick?!?"]

[voice: "It's one word, spelled g-o-a-t-l-i-c-k-e"]

[me: "What the hell does that mean?"]

[voice: "I don't know."]
