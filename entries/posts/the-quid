{After a strange scene where I was eating some fairly tasty food off of a carpeted floor, I found myself in a hospital bed with a young Indian-looking boy standing next to me. His head was unusually adult-like.}

[boy: {Oh, your people would be so much better off if they knew we were watching over you!!}]

[me: "Who's we? I mean, what are you?"]

[boy: "We are the Quid."]

[note {I didn't know the [Latin etymology](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quid) of Quid, but it means "the inherent nature of something"}]

[me: {Watching over how? Can you read my dream journal? The... realityhandbook, it's a LiveJournal.}]

[boy: {Yes. I have produced several translations of it. Yet I have to say that a lot of what you write is over my head--don't know what it means at all.}]

[me: "What am I supposed to do?"]

[boy: {You should be engaging your military-industrial complex. Go for it, they should study you, what are you waiting for?!}]

[me: {They won't listen. If you're watching, how can I get in touch with you?}]

[boy: {Well, most of the children here have already taken their medicine, so they won't notice if one more goes missing. Here.}]

{He gave me a packet with some pills in it that you had to punch through foil.}

{I punched a pill out of it and took it, but it was difficult--as if I were swallowing a large wad of gum.}
