{I was reading a girl's LiveJournal, whose account was "jadebob". The layout was fairly interesting and had "3M" repeated over it as a motif, I wondered if that was a reference to the company or not. In true LJ-drama style, her most recent entries were speaking about her personal reconciliation with someone named Ashley.}

[note [{Though one might think jadebob wouldn't be a popular name on the web for a female, there are a few jadebobs on the web--who appear to be women, such as this <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=126956005">girl on MySpace</a>:} [picture %jadebob.jpg] "...though there are no jadebobs on LiveJournal."]]

{Digging deeper into jadebob's profile, the interest list mentioned "writing in calligraphy", "candy contests", and "fishing". The fishing page had pictures and lists of opinions, such as how lame catch-and-release was.}

[jadebob: ("written") {So you spend all that time and yet still end up eating frozen fish for the next week or two? No thanks!}]

[note {The phrase "candy contest" appears frequently on the web...about 2,880 or so for the exact string. It's usually in reference to things like find-the-blue-m&m and win $20,000. It's not popular enough to be <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/interests.bml?int=candy+contests">a specific LiveJournal interest</a>}]
