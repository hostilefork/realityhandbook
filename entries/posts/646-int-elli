{Someone in a dream was trying to give me her phone number. I was scribbling it on my arm and got 6464INTELLI, as in INTELLIGENCE.}

[note {Upon awakening and looking up 646, it's a Manhattan area code. It's one too many characters for a phone number. I used Skype to call (646) INT-ELLI just to see if it was real, and there's a stock mechanical voice mail that answers with the digits and says to leave a message. Had I left one, I might have said: "Hi, did you know your phone number is 646-INTELLIGENT? Well, minus the gent. By the way, do you give out your phone number in your dreams?"}]
