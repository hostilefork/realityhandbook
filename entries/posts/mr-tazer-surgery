{I was speaking to what appeared to be two small heads stuck on the ends of fishhooks that were pierced through my pinky.}

[me: "Did you know there's life on other planets?"]

[head-one: {There are a lot of galaxies out there in the sky, it would seem likely.}]

[me: {But not just likely, it's actually real. I've been speaking with someone lately.}]

[head-one: "Is he interested in mental telecommunication?"]

[me: "I'd say nearly pathologically so."]

[voice1: "Isn't that you?"]

[me: {Partially, but then there's who's speaking to you now.}]

[voice2: "Are you his girlfriend?"]

[me: "No, I am him, but something else too."]

{The heads seemed to dissolve, and I found myself in a room with a woman I recognized.}

[woman: "Hey Mr. Tazer Surgery."]

[me: "What do you mean by that?"]

[woman: {I'm just reminding you that the Taser Conference is coming up, and it's an important technology that cannot be falling into the wrong hands.}]

[note {The Taser corporation, which makes stun guns, does seem to have conventions. The next one is in July. Obviously I am not going.}]

[me: ("annoyed") {Why am I hearing this from you instead of them? If I'm as good as they say I am, then can't people start being a bit more direct in asking for my help.}]

[her: {Well you know as well as anyone what the problem is. Not enough diamonds.}]

[me: "There are a lot more problems than that."]

[her: "Naturally."]

{My perspective switched to where I was speaking to some unusual looking people who were wearing breathing helmets. They went from looking nearly human with pig-like noses to being almost like purple hippos wearing the breathing helmet. It was as if they were in an atmosphere they could not breathe.}

[hippo: {...so you're a shockingly good match, though about $200,000 or so outside of what we were looking to pay. Tough market right now, all focused on this-or-that bleeding edge animation you know.}]

[me: "Well I'm flexible about the pay."]

[hippo: {Let me compose the letter and get this started right now.}]

{He raised his hands in the air and began a typing motion but there was no visible keyboard he was typing on, kind of like the virtual avatar "I'm typing" animation in Second Life.}
