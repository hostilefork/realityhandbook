[{I was listening to a man who was addressing a group of his friends in his office, and showing them some impressive alien technology.}]
[man: {This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. We'll all spread across the country and have virtually infinite budgets for the manipulation of financial markets. You'll have total power, and be able to own slaves if you want.}]
[{There was a surveillance camera on this meeting, and it was being documented on a website. The group was known as "The Belari" and someone commented that they were "up to their old tricks again."}]
