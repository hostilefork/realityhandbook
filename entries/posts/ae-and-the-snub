{I was looking at an instant messaging program. One of the "status messages" you could pick was AE written with a circumflex A and a euro symbol (e.g. **&acirc;&euro;**). There were several other pre-choosable status messages--and their unfamiliarity cued me into knowing that I was dreaming. I picked the AE status and that caused my body to wildly vibrate.}

{As I began to float in the air, I used my arm to point in the direction I wanted to fly. The vibrating was fairly out of control and unpleasant, but I ignored it and just kind of talked to myself as I went along.}

[me: ("to myself") {Oh, yes... and this is where we would play chess, the food court is around that corner. Wait, what am I talking about, I've never been here before!}]

{There were some people with european accents in police cars. I couldn't tell if they were trying to catch me or if they were just traveling by, but I tried to fly into them so they would catch me.}

[me: "I need... um... medical help?"]

[police: ("inspecting my hand") {Ah, yes... something wrong here. We can fix that up.}]

{He seemed particularly interested in the junction of my thumb to my hand, and put something like a finger guillotine on it. It made a little cut but not all the way.}

[policeman: "Cut cut cut..."]

[me: {Uh, come on. You're not going to cut my thumb off, are you?}]

[policeman: "No, no! That is ridiculous."]

{Nonetheless he continued to hold this thing on my finger, and I decided to force myself awake. I didn't actually awaken, but rather ended up in a bed with someone. Still a little panicked, I grabbed a pillow and knocked them lightly in the head with it to distract them as I jumped out of bed. This left a surprised looking girl who I then gathered I had been sleeping next to.}

[me: {Sorry... I'm sorry, I didn't expect anyone to be in my bed... but I'm not awake yet. I had a stressful dream.}]

{Two guys walked in who looked identical--somewhat Mediterranean. I told them my name and asked what they knew of it.}

[guy-one: "Do we know about him? The jerk? The asshole?"]

[me: {Err... You must have me confused with someone else. There are a lot of people with my name.}]

[guy-two: ("laughing") "Why would people have the same name?"]

[me: "Yeah, I think it's silly... but... they do."]

{We had a discussion about domain names, and they seemed to be operating under the assumption that there was only one person with each name...and that they operated from that "firstnamelastname.com". I asked what kind of interface they had to Earth's Internet, and they said they went through something with a name like "V20x00".}

{Showing me a box for a piece of hardware, it had some chip in it I'd never heard of from Intel called like a "Quadrium". I gathered that the specifications of speed and memory were things that we would consider unrealistic in this Day &amp; Age.}

{Later I followed a man up a large branching telephone pole-type thing. I bounded up it somehow clawing my way. It swayed under our weight.}

[man: {This... hm, I thought it would be quiet up here, but it's not that quiet, and this isn't stable.}]

[me: "No..."]

[man: {So I've been trying to coordinate some action on your issue of duplicate names. We may be able to install a snub of some kind, an exception for you. But the man who was supposed to meet us isn't here, so we'll have to try some other route.}]
