{I found myself in some kind of office where two gray-alien-looking guys were discussing something about immigration and the first day on the job. Becoming lucid, I was picking up and examining objects on a desk with a lot of success at reading them. Then I decided to wander and see what I could find.}

{One area I walked into was a movie theater, and it was playing a music video that didn't have any words. The crowd had all kinds of people, but I didn't talk to them because it was too loud. Leaving that room, I decided that rather than start asking people questions about themselves...I would ask for their identification card and read it.}

[me: <to someone> "May I see your ID card?"]

[someone: {No. Our country doesn't require us to carry those, and hasn't had the requirement for three years now.}]

"There was a piano against the wall."

[me: "Whose piano is that?"]

[person: {It's free. *Everything* is free, but they still pretend like it cost two weeks to make.}]

[me: "Why do they say that?"]

[person: {If everyone could get as much of anything as they wanted instantly, it wouldn't be good for their mental health.}]

[note {Nothing in the conversation really made me feel urgently like waking up and writing it down, so I'm afraid I forgot a lot of details.}]
