{I was at my grandmother's house speaking with Morton Harket, lead singer of the band A-Ha.}

[me: "Well, how do you like it here in America?"]

[morton-harket: {Everything is incredibly empty. Not just people not showing up for the concerts, but for instance, in here...the walls are all white and no pictures.}]

[me: {Well I agree, but there's better interior design in lots of places.}]

{We wandered into the kitchen, and my Mom was at a table.}

[me: {I'd say my apartment has been decorated pretty well considering the budget, wouldn't you?}]

[mom: "Yes, now that's been done it's time we socialized."]

[me: {Sorry, can't stay long. I'm asleep and dreaming right now, going to be gone in a second.}]

[mom: "No you're not. Why would you say that?"]

[me: "Because I'm able to tell. Sorry, bye."]

{With that I sorta passed out and woke up to start writing on a laptop. As I turned it on, I noticed I had a new email, titled 'The Old Fraggle Likes to Hoggle'. Before I could open it, there was a disruption and the machine logged out.}

{Tinkering with the computer and trying to get logged back in, I found another mail titled "Getting on the same page." Replying to it, I began to type frantically (and with numerous errors) a completely unreadable message about my name and who I was. I was awoken by sirens, which turned out to actually be outside my apartment.}
