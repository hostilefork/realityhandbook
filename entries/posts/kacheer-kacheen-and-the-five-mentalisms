    {I was listening to a lecture from someone named "Kacheer Kacheen". It was a historical study of his interests in "mental telephony", and he had broken down things into a system of five "mentalisms".}

    {While walking around an environment, I stopped in a very crowded coffee shop and began talking to people. I pointed to the sky.}

dialog [

    me: "Do you know about Earth? A planet?"

    them: {We are blocked from travel by Centaus Netrinous. The blocks are necessary because the blue meanies cannot be allowed to reach other planets.}

print {At some point strange goo started coming out of my mouth.}

dialog [

    me: "What's going wrong with my mouth?"

    them: "You have a jaw distitution."

note {Distitution is not an English word, as far as I can tell... just a typo for destitution or distribution.}
