[note {The date on this entry is very approximate, as I documented it long after the fact due to its lasting significance.}]
[{In a non-lucid dream I was visiting a fortune teller, and felt a little awkward to be there. It was hot, and a fan was running behind her desk.}]
[me: "How much is this going to cost?"]
[fortune-teller: "It will be $20 per hour."]
[{Realizing that I'd only been there 15 minutes so far, and that this was pretty cheap entertainment, I decided to relax.}]
[me: "Okay that's fine. I'll take one hour then."]
[fortune-teller: {The most important thing you need to learn about is going to be the concept of <i>sether</i>. It was outlined best in a book by...}]
[{When I woke up, my face was toward a fan next to my bed that was running.}]
[note [[{I'd never heard the word 'sether' before, nor had I ever studied Tarot--despite taking a few paranormal things seriously, I skip horoscopes and tarot. But looking up sether up on Google I found the word mentioned in a PDF file <a href="http://www.tarot.org.il/Library/PFCase/Oracle%20of%20the%20Tarot.pdf">Oracle of the Tarot</a>, which says:}] [quote {The special mode of consciousness associated in Hebrew Wisdom with 7 is the Occult or Secret intelligence. The Hebrew word here translated "Occult or Secret" is [...] Sether, signifying "to shut up, to cover, to hide, to veil, to conceal."}] [{...which seems like the very kind of word that a real fortune teller might bring up in a visit.}]]]
