[{I was banging my head against the wall in a dream while talking to someone about why the Blur video for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWUil383us4">Coffee and TV</a> was unable to transmit.}]
[guy: {Well we've found out it's getting blocked by this network. We've seen this before, but what does this data have in common?}]
[me: {Okay, I understand the trend. They're filtering it because it <i>looks too much like an advertisement</i>.}]
[note [["The video features an animated milk carton:"] [picture %coffee_and_tv.jpg] [{...and it is possible that a primitive screening system might interpret the video as an ad for milk instead of an artistic work.}]]]
