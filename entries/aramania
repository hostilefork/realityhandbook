[{I was typing on a computer terminal...making a few errors, but able to do a decent job. What was going on was some kind of text adventure game. I tried typing in words like "system" and "version" to figure out what kind of computer it was, and I got back a lot of stuff I'd never heard of.}]
[{It occurred to me to make an effort to remember one word which was ARAMANAIA. I used that the end was <a href="http://aia.org/">AIA</a> to help me remember.}]
[note [[{It sounded like nonsense, but a Google search upon awakening amazingly found only four hits, one of which was on a <a href="http://groups.msn.com/SchoolofSpiritualKnowledge/psychicartspiritualportraits.msnw?action=ShowPhoto&PhotoID=1565">"psychic spiritual portrait"</a> of someone apparently named Aramanaia:}] [picture %aramania.jpg] [{When I wrote a letter to the 'School of Spiritual Knowledge' inquiring about what this was about, I got a response saying that the picture had been uploaded by a member with no context and thus there was no further information.}]]]
[{Some manipulations were happening on the screen that I wasn't causing to happen, so I thought maybe someone was watching me type. I tried to initiate a conversation by typing.}]
[me: "Hello?"]
[other: "Oh... yes?"]
[me: "What's going on? What is this game?"]
[other: "Oh it's shiite [sic] someone uploaded."]
[{The next thing I saw was a directory listing where the files were. The game was called "outpost". After some failed attempts to type more questions and getting puzzled responses back, I decided to change tactics.}]
[me: "Would you like to meet in person?"]
[other: "Now?"]
[me: "Yes!"]
[{This caused something to change radically, and I was suddenly reading words that had been printed three dimensionally on layers of glass. It explained that meeting now would violate a certain condition and be a bad thing.}]
[{I woke up, long enough to note down the name ARAMANAIA and go back to sleep.}]
