[{I was in a place that looked a bit like a shopping mall, and on the wall between some stores there was a device that looked like some kind of control panel. A person I felt like I was traveling with tinkered with it until it started playing 'Mickey' by Toni Basil.}]
[me: {No, don't turn it up that loud... turn it down. Okay, not that far down. All right.}]
[{They disappeared and I realized I was laying on my back messing with some black shoelaces. The hard plastic end of one of the laces had come off. Someone who seemed like a mall employee came up and glared at the wall, and then at me.}]
[me: {I didn't touch it, that was some other guy. By the way, do you know if shoe stores sell replacements for these tips on shoelaces? What do you call these things?}]
[note {Rumor has it those tips have a name, and that they're called "aglets"}]

[employee: ("annoyed") "No, you can't buy those here."]
[me: {That's too bad, seems wasteful to have to replace the whole thing when the shoelace is fine.}]
[{She walked away and then my perspective shifted to where I was a bit far off, observing a conversation between some uniformed people who were walking in a line.}]
[uniformed-man-one: {This is extremely suspicious. Six of our guys had unscheduled upgrades to the Michael program.}]
[uniformed-man-two: "I don't trust it. Who did the upgrades?"]
[uniformed-man-one: {They were Air guys. From the Air Force, I mean to say.}]
[{Though I felt I was just an invisible spectator who was far away, the line stopped and one man turned in my direction. He seemed to speak directly to me.}]
[uniformed-man-one: {I need you to remember something. Think you can do it?}]
[me: ("startled") "I can try and write it down when I wake up."]
[uniformed-man-one: "Vitomin 1-8..."]
[note {He articulated it as 'vi-toe-min' and not 'vi-taa-min'.}]
[me: "Wait. What are the numbers?"]
[uniformed-man-one: "Vitomin 1-8-9-19"]
[me: {Vitamin 1-8-9-19... hope that's right I'll write it down!}]
[{I jumped out of bed and leapt to the computer to try and type it in. A girl was looking over my shoulder.}]
[girl: {No, no... this is mixed up. Apple Computer and Animal Computer are not the same thing.}]
[me: {What are you looking at? I'm writing down these... these vitamin numbers, I was in a mall with some guys complaining about an upgrade to a Michael program. Something about the air force. I got the feeling it was like they were speaking about people actually getting software upgrades, you know, like to your brain.}]
[girl: "I mean the numbers, they're confused."]
[{Then I realized I wasn't awake yet, and actually woke up.}]
