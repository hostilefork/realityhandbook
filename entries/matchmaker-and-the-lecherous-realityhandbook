[{In mid-conversation, I was interrupted by a woman who was trying to be some kind of matchmaker. A thin and pretty dark-haired girl wearing some gothic-type clubwear stood by her.}]
[matchmaker: {This is the girl I'd been meaning to introduce you to, her name is Melanie. You'd be perfect for each other, she likes blondes too.}]
["I gave Melanie a hug."]
[me: {Hello. I'm pleased to meet you. Do you remember these situations when you wake up?}]
[melanie: "Sometimes, but not often."]
[{I asked a couple of other questions, and reached out to hold her by the waist. Despite being unusually forward in petting her, she didn't seem to mind as I felt the lace of her underwear through her skirt. But at one point I kissed her, and she swiftly retreated to a couch. I followed her to apologize.}]
[me: {I'm sorry, being so forward is really not my usual style. I never really know whether any negative response I get is due to my own subconscious and needs to overcome, or if I'm actually being disrespectful to another being.}]
[{She didn't say anything, but stared at me and made me feel awkward.}]
[me: ("embarrassed") {This is such an odd situation. You have to understand that dreams are supposed to be the place where you're free from the cultural norms--and I mean, that's being taken away from me. Soon I'll wake up, back to my weird little life that I have to live even after all this has happened. It's just hard you know.}]
[{A guy sitting next to us got kind of irritated with her silence.}]
[guy: ("to Melanie") {Come on. Can't your understand at least HALF of what he's saying?}]
