[{Had an early evening dream, after coffee and a long drive. Was staring at something that looked like a music video, but I couldn't hear any of the music. I issued vocal commands to it, along the lines of "show me something!" Nothing happened.}]
[{Since there was a screen in front of me, I started making motions at typing, and words showed up on the screen when I did:}]
[me: "Hey, show me something!"]
[text: {I am being very slow and going one sentence at a time, and waiting to see that you have typed something before continuing. It would not be very interesting to you to see a million lines fly by at once.}]
[me: {I am sorry for the typos. I am much better at this in the waking state. Is there any way you can contact me while awake?}]
[{We were both typing on the same screen and somewhat interfering with each other. The other typist loaded a text-based email program, where we could compose messages.}]
[note [[{It strongly resembled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_(e-mail_client)">PINE</a>:}] [picture %pine.png] [{...with labeled function keys at the bottom of the screen.}]]]
[{I tried to indicate my email address... but my typing began to atrophy, and I realized I was giving them old addresses that probably no longer work. They took control and paged through a bit of stuff that was writing about "Sunshine's Blog". The page seemed to have a long tagline.}]
[note {Survey the many hits for "Sunshine's Blog" on Google, some of them have a new age or religious slant. But I guess that's par for the course of people who'd give their blog such a name.}]
