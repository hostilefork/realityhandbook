[{I was applying for citizenship of some sort, and I sat down at a desk with a paper to fill out my information. I kept losing the paper, and picking up other papers, until there was a heap of papers on my desk. An administrative person walked by and shook her head.}]
[administrator: {You shouldn't get lost in the paperwork. Be careful and take it one page at a time.}]
[me: ("shrugging") {It's not <i>my</i> fault. It seems like your papers are breeding here on the desk as we speak. Why...just look!}]
[{The papers started heaping up, and I felt I was causing this telekinetically. At this point I was feeling a bit cocky, so I directed my attention to a nearby bookshelf.}]
[me: {This whole place is a disaster, your books don't even stay on the shelves!!}]
[{A book jumped off the shelf and I guided it so it slammed up against a nearby support beam and then went flying back the other direction. Then I made another book jump up and hit the beam from the other side. People seemed to take that in stride, so I walked around pulling off a few other interesting tricks...like getting a door to lock and barricade itself so some people couldn't get out of a room.}]
[{It seemed like I was then eaten by a herd of giant fuzzy dragon-looking things, though it was hard to tell.}]
