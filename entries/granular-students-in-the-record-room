[{I was on some kind of hovering platform, looking down at people. There were fights breaking out among them, and as I went to the edge to look I came close to falling off. It tilted more and more, and we started heading for the ground. The people below were screaming.}]
[me: ("jokingly") {Hey, if we're going to crash... aim for Paris Hilton!}]
[{Somehow that lightened everyone's mood and we sort of bounced and no one ended up being hurt. Getting off the platform and looking around I saw a large number of books. For some reason, I had a worry that they were spam books... generated by an automated process and not making any sense. But I picked a couple up and they seemed okay from the covers.}]
[me: {Can anyone suggest to me an example of a great and groundbreaking book?}]
[woman: ("picking up one close by") "This is very good."]
[{The title of the book she had picked was something like <i>Manifesting Intent in the Creative Process</i>.}]
[me: "What makes it good? What's the idea?"]
[woman: {I generally think the point is that you read it to find out.}]
[me: "I don't have the time for that."]
[{I flipped to the back cover and tried to skim the summary, it was an oddly shaped book... tall and narrow. While trying to make out the words, I was accosted by an elderly librarian woman.}]
[librarian: ("snarkily") {We generally prefer it if students do not use the record room if it is not for a specific purpose.}]
[me: "Record room? Huh?"]
[librarian: {And we also restrict access to full students only, and rarely allow granular students in here.}]
[me: {Student of what? Am I a student? What am I studying?}]
[librarian: ("angry") "Are you a student AT ALL?"]
[me: {Look, don't get angry. Let's just say I have... uh. Well I guess it's a medical condition. Sometimes I know who I am and sometimes I don't, it's very confusing.}]
[librarian: {Oh amnesia is it? Well, I'm not sympathetic, you want to see a *real* medical condition!?}]
[{She sat down and started doing something odd unbuttoning her shirt and showing a gaping gross something or another going on in her abdominal area. I didn't see the details because I looked away.}]
[me: {Okay, no, please. You misunderstand, I wasn't trying to get sympathy. This is research. I'm in an unknown place gathering information about how I got here, about what kind of place this is--what kind of records these are--and what kind of students you are talking about.}]
[librarian: {Hmm. I wonder if you're onto something that Nash fellow was onto. Nice enough kid, always here in the record room on some kind of business.}]
[{I became a bit agitated about how long I'd have before I woke up. There was a guy who looked a bit like a zombie who walked in, but ignored me and started typing on a computer terminal. I suddenly noticed that there were a lot of younger people converging in on us who looked very intent and looked a bit like a cross between a military troop and a documentary film crew.}]
[me: {Well, here comes the cavalry, maybe this is why I'm here.}]
[{I walked toward their approaching numbers, and sang a little song as a joke where I recited my name and how I was there in the "motherf*in" house. Somehow they all decided to repeat me, and stood at attention.}]
[me: {Hey thanks. But you don't have to sing. I was just singing a little goofy song for the recording devices, try and defuse tension. Humor.}]
[{A black guy holding a small metal device that looked like some sort of all-stainless-steel swiss army knife stepped up to me, surveyed the scene, and shook his head and gestured it at me.}]
[{<b>guy</b>: "When you take this all back to the money thing...and I <i>know</i> you're going to do that one day...I'm coming after <i>you</i>."}]
[{<b>me</b>: "Hmmm... I guess that was the whole point of Star Wars? Anakin using talents for good and then later, when he's older and circumstances change, becomes Darth Vader?"}]
["I woke up while finishing the thought."]
