{The internet is a funny place. Communications constantly disrupted by hackers, network failures, viruses. The simple inclusion of a word that an email filter doesn't like can mean a message you send won't be delivered. Sadly, we're all so self-doubting that if we get no response, we usually assume the person just didn't want to talk to us! :(}

{Making matters worse, content is scraped and pasted on places without the original author knowing it. Same happens with photos; stolen and used for other purposes. Seems the Native Americans were right when they said people steal your soul when your photograph is taken...and the Christians were right when they say *"Thou shalt not worship graven images..."*}

{All that nonsense aside, **I want to talk to you**!! And if I don't want to, I'll tell you why, and give you a good reason...}

{For starters, you can try picking this site's name (minus the org) and send email using that service that Google offers. If that doesn't work, improvise! As far as I know I'm a real person and there's more than one way to find me, at least until I'm dead. After that, no promises.}

{Worst case scenario if you don't hear back: Make your own blog and talk about my site and things in it. I'll see if I can find it and contact you, as per the famous [Kibo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibo_(Usenet))! :)}
