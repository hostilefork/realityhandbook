realityhandbook is a simple system for making a website which contains dream
logs that fit a stylized "screenplay" format.  You write your dream logs in a
dialect of the Rebol language.  The entries are then analyzed for structure,
building a character list and letting you sort the dreams by tag.  

You can browse the result at:

    http://realityhandbook.org
    
The website is built out as static files, but those static files can be
enhanced by a system like Django.  The original goal was to make a site that's
very straightforward, does not require a database on the backend, and which is
easy to crawl.

The input format is a series of blocks, representing sequential sections of
the dream dialogue.  Here are the block formats:


EXPOSITION

Simple exposition or narration is just a string inside of a block.

    [{See, I'm naked in church when I meet a dinosaur.  I try to run but
      my feet have been nailed to the floor.  Then a midget pushes me through
      a revolving door.  And I'm back in the very same place I was before...}]

( apologies to Weird Al: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4fezNM7-Kk )

I considered adapting the dialect to allow an unadorned string like this to 
not require a block.  But for the moment, having the block is nice.


SIDENOTES

Sidenotes are indicated with a block beginning with the word NOTE.  These are
used to add additional research (such as information found on Google after
waking up).  They are also used to provide corrections or information which
may otherwise inform the reader about details I may know but that were not
presented in the dream.

    [note {I told the dream alien it was the year 2000, but it's 
     actually 2013 at the time of this writing.}]

Multi-line notes are achieved by instead of having a string as the second
argument, instead using a block.  In that block, all line formats are legal;
and the template generator will wrap that up in a blockquote.

    [note [[{One.}] [{Two.}] [{Three}]]]


DIALOGUE

A line of dialogue starts with a hyphenated character name followed by a colon.
Although any "SET-WORD!" (in Rebol terminology) would be legal here, keeping
the names as simple as possible and not including punctuation or numbers is
best.

    [taco-bell-dog: {Yo quiero taco bell.}]

One practice that I deprecated was the use of quotes around the name of
someone who merely looked like (or reminded me) of someone.  So for instance:
if I start talking to an asian man who reminds me of Mr. Sulu from Star Trek,
I would now call that dream character [asian-man:] instead of "Mr Sulu".
The only time I will use a proper name of a person or character is if they
introduce themselves as such.  In that case, the absence of quotes and
"taking their word for it" is implictly to be questioned... as these are
dreams, after all.

It's possible to add an action to a character by enclosing it in parentheses
as the second item in a dialogue block.

    [purple-cheetah: ("growling fiercely") {Give me back that shoe pie!}]

The contents of the parentheses must be a string enclosed in quotes.


PICTURES

The picture facility is a little bit half-baked at the moment, but what it does
is lets you specify a URL and a caption.  So for instance:

    [picture http://example.com/image.jpg {Example image}]


SYNCING

There's a lot of SFTP overhead to rewrite all the files each time.  One can 
speed things up via RSYNC.  Here is my /etc/rsyncd.conf

The configuration for
RSYNC is in the /etc/rsyncd.conf, and it should be set to something like:

	motd file = /etc/rsyncd.motd
	log file = /var/log/rsyncd.log
	pid file = /var/run/rsyncd.pid
	lock file = /var/run/rsync.lock
	read only = yes
	list = no

	[realityhandbook-templates]
	   path = *** # path to where the templates are goes here
	   comment = RealityHandbook Template Sync
	   uid = *** # user id goes here
	   gid = nogroup
	   read only = no
	   list = yes
	   auth users = *** # user id here
	   secrets file = /etc/rsyncd.scrt

If that is configured properly, then realityhandbook-templates names a 
directory that can be sync'd.

On the server side, run: 

	sudo rsync --daemon --no-detach -vvv

On the client side, run:

	rsync --progress --recursive templates/* [your login @ your domain]::realityhandbook-templates

If that doesn't work, then something's wrong and the :: syntax for using the
configuration may be broken.  I managed to have some success w/this alternative:

	rsync --progress --recursive templates/* [your login @ your domain]::[remote path]
