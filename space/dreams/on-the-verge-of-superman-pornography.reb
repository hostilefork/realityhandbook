[{I was in some kind of arcade, with a lot of machines. From context I knew I was dreaming, and I was interested in seeing as much as I could before waking up.}]
[{The machine I was in front of had a selection screen, and you were picking from various super heroes (Superman, Batman, Spiderman, and many I couldn't recognize). There were options for the game--such as whether you could fly, or what kind of penalties would happen to your character if you were killed. As I scrolled through the choices, I noticed one of them was a scenario of Superman where women were trying to steal your clothes.}]
[{Drilling down into the settings for the women-steal-your-clothes edition, it had a publisher... listed as "Verge". There was a trailer for the game which had you in dungeon-like environments fighting large dominatrix women in white lace outfits.}]
[note {I have a less than encyclopedic knowledge of pornography companies. But I have heard of Vivid Entertainment...and not Verge. There is a company called <a href="http://www.vergeentertainment.com/home.html">Verge Entertainment</a> that makes ordinary TV, and an odd website called <a href="http://www.verge-gaming.net">verge-gaming.net</a> which only contains the text "By EL_MuHaMMeD", apparently the residual remains of a group of game players who would play multiplayer games. There is also a super-mario-like platforming engine called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verge_%28gaming%29">Verge</a>.}]
