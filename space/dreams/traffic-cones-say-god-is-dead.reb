[{I was laying on my back on a bed, and closed my eyes but could still see the stucco-type ceiling with a 3-D texture of white paint. Checking to see whether it was real or not, I felt my eyelids to see if they were possibly cracked open--but they weren't. Information started scrolling by on the ceiling, star-wars-intro style.}]
[{Each paragraph was preceded by an icon of a traffic cone, and the words were flying by fast. I tried to pay attention to the content, which was academic and textual in nature. This switched to shorter messages, and I started being able to read them better.}]
[traffic-cone: "god is dead"]
[traffic-cone: "god is dead"]
[traffic-cone: "god is dead"]
[traffic-cone: "god is god"]
[traffic-cone: "deep"]
[traffic-cone: "epic work"]
[note {Perhaps wishful thinking, but I understood the "epic work" was an analysis of me and my projects.}]
[me: "Thanks?"]
[traffic-cone: "thanks"]
[me: {So, it's fun and all, but I'm lonely here. So if you could send someone to keep me company I'd really appreciate it.}]
[{A giant screen appeared, levitating in the room. It had lots of numbers and information, and one number was running shorter and shorter down to zero.}]
[note [[{It resembled an electronic clapboard that would be used for tracking timecode in a movie:}] [picture %digital_clapboard.jpg] [{...though the numbers were measuring distance in meters, not time.}]]]
[{When the counter hit zero, there was a knock at the door, and I got up off the bed and went to answer it. I was a bit disappointed to see it was my mom.}]
[mom: {I'd called and you hadn't answered the phone, why not?}]
[{The next thing I knew I was watching some people who had put a polar bear and a tiger together to see which would win in a fight. It struck me as rather cruel.}]
