[{I was in some kind of apartment complex, and there were several black people hanging around. One of them had a Rubik's Cube. He showed it to me and I looked it over.}]
[me: {Even though you have several sides solved, I don't think this is going to be possible to finish. There are too many white stickers. You can only have 9 total on all faces of the cube.}]
[black-man: ("laughing") {Ha ha! Well of course *you'd* notice that. What else would we expect from The White Mayor of Wal-Mart!!!}]
[me: ("angry") "What did you call me?!"]
[black-man: ("laughing harder") {Oh no...I'm <i>sorry</i>! I'm sorry... Mr. Africa Crack, <i>Sir</i>.}]
[note {The impression I got was that this apartment complex was our base, from which we were running some kind of Fight-Club like operation.}]
