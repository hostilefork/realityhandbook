[{I was in the kitchen at my grandmother's house, and spitting little seed-like things out of my mouth that kept reappearing. Because the lighting was bad I couldn't see if they were alive and moving on their own like bugs, but I was concerned that they might be. So I kept trying to get better light to look at them.}]
[{Eventually I decided the more important question was whether I was dreaming or not, so I walked around the house until I satisfied myself that I was. Finding my Dad, I began to question.}]
[me: {What are these seeds that are showing up in my mouth?}]
[dad: {Those are your children. You should save some of them to help you with writing letters.}]
[note {I don't know if he meant they'd help in forming letters of the alphabet, or in composing longer correspondence.}]
[{He zipped off far away...towards some kind of mountain. This made me furious, and I decided to chase after him. Bounding and flying willfully I was rather determined to catch him--and rather than try to go over the mountain I decided to go right through it. I conjured a door in the mountain, leading into a dark tunnel, and then I conjured a torch to light my way.}]
[{When I finally caught him, I challenged him with more questions that I don't quite remember. I began asking other people around what kind of tricks I could use to stay in the dream and not wake up, and they weren't helpful so I did.}]
