[{I got into a fight with someone in a dream, and though I was holding out fairly well I realized that it was a losing battle. So I backed off and called a truce. Almost instantly the dream solidified, and the same person I had been fighting started giving me information about someone I had known in the past.}]
[me: {Hmmm...that doesn't sound like something he would do. But I'll ask you this: what is MY name?}]
[him: "I don't like that question."]
[me: {If you can't tell me my name, then I really doubt it would be possible to give me detailed factual information about people from my past. Knowing my name seems much easier.}]
[{A short while later I was in an industrial building that I knew to be full of explosives. There was a guy there who I perceived as being like Edward Norton's character in Fight Club who was masterminding the bombs. The police came in with plans to arrest him but he made a menacing gesture like he was going to light a cigarette, and they realized the slightest fire would cause the building to explode.}]
[{Several bomb-squad scientists came in and were mixing together chemicals. There was a roster of where they were from, and I noticed some were from Finland. Realizing that they weren't going to be able to stop the pyromaniac, I confronted him.}]
[me: {I'm about to wake up. So why don't you just tell me how this story is going to end?}]
[{In response, he threw something that caused a fire and the whole place exploded. People were running for their lives, but I decided to walk into the fire. It wasn't painful but it made me feel static-y, like when your foot falls asleep. As parts of my body were replaced with a white frothing foam, I flew uncontrollably into the air, where I met another flying guy.}]
[me: "How do I stop flying and get back to the ground?"]
[{He turned upside down so his head pointed at the ground and we both went down and touched the ground.}]
[him: {I advise you to pick up a stick or some other object.}]
[me: {Does that then imply a commitment to being on the ground so you stop flying?}]
[{He didn't answer, but we had landed in a cluster of people pointing at the tiny moths crawling around on the dirt.}]
[people: {These moths are lousy pets, they don't come when you call.}]
[me: {Er, yeah. Ok. Well, if you call that a 'MOTH'... what would you call ME?}]
[person1: "A mirror!"]
[person2: "A frog!"]
[me: ("to person2") "You said frog. Do you know what a mirror was?"]
[note {My line of thinking there was that if a mirror reflects what you show it then maybe the first person was right...I was a mirror and person2 was a frog seeing itself.}]
[{This was interrupted when George Clooney and some other celebrity (possibly Edward Norton, as from earlier) walked by. They paused and looked at me...and then continued to walk. I decided to follow them.}]
[me: {What's the deal here? What's going on? I need to know because I'll be waking up any moment.}]
["Shortly thereafter I did wake up."]
