[{I was in a house with people, and began asking them questions:}]
[me: "Have you heard about Earth?"]
[them: "We saw something on <i>360</i> about it."]
[note {I somehow understood 360 as being an investigative reporting program, a la CBS's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes">60 Minutes</a>. Interesting, both 360 and 60 indicate full rotations around a circle, but one is degrees and the other is minutes.}]
[me: "What details do you know? Where are we now?"]
[one-man: {Don't tell the special person too much about what is going on.}]
[note {I felt the sense in which they were using the word "special" seemed to be "handicapped", because of the negative tone, but I may be misinterpreting.}]
[me: {Don't worry about giving me information, I can handle it. I've seen <i>The Matrix</i>, I'm ready for pretty much anything.}]
[someone: ("angry") {Come on, you're from Cydonia(?)! You've got enough privileges as it is!}]
[note {There are a few things to which the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cydonia">Cydonia</a> applies. This includes the Greek Goddess of heroic endeavor, an asteroid orbiting the sun, and the infamous 'face' on Mars. None of these were known to me prior to the dream.}]
[{The exchange continued to be frustrating, so I went into another room where the people were nicer. They expressed dismay at the other people and tried to explain some things they had been saying.}]
[them: {When you thought they said 'bite peg' they were actually using an idiom, that one about 'biting one's leg'.}]
[note {Perhaps this was supposed to be 'pulling one's leg'...meaning to joke?}]
[them: "Don't go back to that room. Sleep in here with us."]
