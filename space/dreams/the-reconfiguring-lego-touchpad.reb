[{In a room, I had seen a device built of LEGOs that was able to reconfigure itself. I followed out toward a crowd and asked them about it.}]
[me: {Can someone tell me how that LEGO device works? I'd like it explained in layman's terms.}]
[{I remained rather focused while people seemed ignore me and talk about music.}]
[me: {Let me stress that I'm rather serious about wanting information. Please stop changing the subject.}]
[{An older guy listened, and walked me back in the room. He let me examine them, and it seemed like they had magnets on them. When they were placed on a special pad that looked and felt like a touchpad on a laptop, the pieces would jump into the correct position.}]
[me: {Can I see the inside of the parts or have them broken open?}]
[old-guy: {We created an artificial intelligence, but at the same time we also had to build a distraction device to keep it confused. The confusion is necessary--because without that, it goes ballistic and thinks too fast for it to consider our communications relevant.}]
