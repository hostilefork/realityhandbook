[{After a nice lascivious pseudo-lucid dream, I next found myself in a bed. A preoccupied man seated next to the bed was tuning numbers into a machine, like using a radio dial. The number 95.5 stands out.}]
[me: {What does that machine do? Does it have anything to do with people being able to share information in dreams?}]
[man: "Yes...sometimes they can."]
[me: "Will you outline the way the machine works?"]
[man: {No, I'm not going to do that on the spot. Here, read this article on the machine's inventor.}]
[{I looked at the article, and it was about a a man from MIT whose name was Tony Romero.}]
