[{In a bizarre dream, a young frat-type guy identified himself to me as "Manservant". He was wearing a shirt that said "USC".}]
[note {He said manservant like it were some kind of band name, and music played when he introduced himself.}]
[manservant: {Yeah, when I was tired of being Justin Timberlake I used one of your identities in Armageddon.}]
[me: ("menacingly") "Well I'm onto you now."]
[note [[{Although manservant seems like an unlikely user name to use, someone named "Benjamin" has the Myspace page:}] [picture %manservant_benjamin.jpg] [{...though it looks quite inauthentic to me, as his friends are Puma shoes and Tom.}]]]
