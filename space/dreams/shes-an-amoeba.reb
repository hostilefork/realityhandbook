[{Somehow I was able to read someone's computer terminal, including all of their instant message chatting. I was also involved in the chat, but I started typing out what I saw on the screen word for word, as if I wanted to let them know they were being monitored. They seemed to log off.}]
[{Next I was reading an account of a difficult math and logic problem involving drainage coming off of a road. This road had certain properties on its straight segments, and other properties on its curved segments. My impression was that this was a very difficult problem, and I was arguing with a girl about whether it was an easy problem or a hard one.}]
[me: {Look, if you're so smart...then solve this drainage problem. If you can do it in 24 hours, I'll sleep with you. Most assuredly you won't find the answer to this on Google!}]
[her: {I'm not surprised such a challenge would be issued by someone who celebrates all his holidays based on mathematical constants!}]
[note {The implication I took away from this would be that I was the sort of person who declared March 14th officially "pi day", for 3.14. I have never done that, but I know people who do.}]
[me: {Aaaargh. I don't celebrate holidays based on their mathematical constants. I am dreaming. Do you even know who I AM?}]
[{I typed out my full name a few times. She wrote back that her name was Becky (or "Beki") Levinson. The scene shifted to me and a friend of mine looking at the web page of an MIT student named Becky Levinson. I got the impression she was some kind of materials scientist, studying things like graphite compounds.}]
[{We were looking at a few copies of the page, one of which was missing the second run of digits in her contact information. We were trying read off the number in a way that we could double check it, since everything was fuzzy due to dreaming.}]
[me: {This is a lot of strain. I'm going to have to give up.}]
[friend: {All right, then I'm going with your theory that she's an amoeba.}]
[me: ("confused") "What?"]
[friend: "I'm writing our message really REALLY small."]
[note [[{On the topic of very small text, I've noticed lately some spam messages which in their HTML have really tiny white writing. Real world example from Craigslist:}] [{<span style="font-size: 1px; float: right; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">byuruedrnozovzukufhseambmixqgozqayavxkqtecqmeznlyjatrllzhvsvpnsopoxuljgitfbdycknisrhpbbyuruedrnozovzukufhseambmixqgozqayavxkqtecqmeznlyjatrllzhvsvpnsopoxuljgitfbdycknisrhpbbyuruedrnozovzukufhseambmixqgozqayavxkqtecqmeznlyjatrllzhvsvpnsopoxuljgitfbdycknisrhpbbyuruedrnozovzukufhseambmixqgozqayavxkqtecqmeznlyjatrllzhvsvpnsopoxuljgitfbdycknisrhpbbyuruedrnozovzukufhseambmixqgozqayavxkqtecqmeznlyjatrllzhvsvpnsopoxuljgitfbdycknisrhpbbyuruedrnozovzukufhseambmixqgozqayavxkqtecqmeznlyjatrllzhvsvpnsopoxuljgitfbdycknisrhpbbyuruedrnozovzukufhseambmixqgozqayavxkqtecqmeznlyjatrllzhvsvpnsopoxuljgitfbdycknisrhpbbyuruedrnozovzukufhseambmixqgozqayavxkqtecqmeznlyjatrllzhvsvpnsopoxuljgi</span>}] ["...which I find interesting."]]]
