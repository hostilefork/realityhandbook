[{I was at a strange theme restaurant where Muppets were performing. The music was a little sloppy, and the host Muppet was very critical of the performers. I was concerned about the fact that I had come in to watch the show but hadn't ordered anything, but people I talked to were critical of the food--saying that although there were many options, nothing was very good.}]
[{I was holding a cup of coffee and attempting to put on several jackets, when a girl started scolding me.}]
[girl: {Be careful! You can't spill that coffee here, it will go into a drainage spout that can only handle Jose Cuervo.}]
[{We chatted a little, and as I became more aware that it was a dream the chat evolved into words on a piece of notebook paper. I could scribble on the paper what I wanted to say, and more notes from her would come up in response. Somehow my view switched to looking her up on Myspace.}]
[note {This Myspace homepage was strange, because search was the first thing you did--like Google. Currently you have to go Search->By Email Address. But searching by email address was on the front page.}]
[{When her page came up I noted that it said she was in a relationship. I clicked on the profile she'd designated as her partner, and saw who it was. I browsed his page and he seemed like an ok guy. I opened a chat window with her.}]
[me: "Hey there! I'm reading about you, right now! :)"]
[her: "Are you at home?"]
[{As soon as I got her response, I started hearing a certain pattern of beeps. Suddenly I became a bit paranoid about giving away my location. Realizing I was on a bed with a laptop, I felt an extreme discomfort as the beeps closed in on me. Somehow I had the knowledge that I could *feel* electromagnetic fields. As I panicked, I snapped into a conversation with a strange looking Asian man.}]
[me: "What is GOING ON?"]
[asian-man: {I've been sent as a representative to speak with you.}]
[me: {Well what am I supposed to do? What are you going to tell me? What have you told the others like me?}]
[asian-man: {Honestly, I don't know any others. And I only transferred to this department recently.}]
[me: "Why would I be the only one who experiences this?"]
[him: "You're a Dark Earth colony."]
[{Our conversation was interrupted when the Asian man got in a confrontation with someone else. Guns were involved, but I somehow confiscated all the guns and hid them, as if I had more power than anyone else in the conversation.}]
