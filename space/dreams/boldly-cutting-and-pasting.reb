[{I ran into some people who were were doing what looked like construction paper activities kids would make in Kindergarten. However, they were trying to exchange astronomy data and other things. I helped identify and sort the papers, one was an arrangement of the planets around the sun.}]
[me: {These look right... Mercury, Venus, Earth... Earth is the planet I'm on. Then it's Mars and Jupiter is the big one. But wait, there are too many planets here.}]
[someone: "This diagram includes Ganymede and moons."]
[note {I'm not very educated about names of moons, and while awake if you had asked me to name any, the only one I could have come up with was IO. So I was a bit surprised to look up and find that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganymede_(moon)">Ganymede</a> was actually the name of a moon.}]
[{On another page were some Star Trek symbols of the starfleet logo and an outline of the enterprise.}]
[someone: "Can you identify these symbols?"]
[me: {Those are from a fictional TV show called Star Trek.}]
[{I noticed someone who looked and dressed like Spock watering a plant, and I held the paper in front of him.}]
[me: ("sarcastically") "I don't suppose YOU remember these?"]
[spock: ("blank look") "My memory has been erased."]
