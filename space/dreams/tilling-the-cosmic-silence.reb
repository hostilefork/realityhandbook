[{I was in a very apocalyptic scenario, with some people who were trying to get together to leave a ravaged area. One person stopped to ask if they could go back and get some of their CDs.}]
[me: "No, keep moving."]
[{Someone pulled out a remote control and pressed play, causing some classical music to start playing from one of the buildings we had left. He turned it up all the way.}]
[person: {I'm glad that at least I left that disc in the player. So Beethoven is still out there, tilling the cosmic silence...I guess he always will be.}]
[me: {If you were going to create some kind of sound beacon, then we should leave a sign saying which direction we were going in case anyone is attracted by it. But I don't know how long the power grid will be working here.}]
[{When I awoke, I decided that "tilling the cosmic silence" was a pretty interesting thing for him to have said.}]
