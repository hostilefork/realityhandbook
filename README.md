# REALITYHANDBOOK

This project is the source code for a website that documents literally hundreds of [lucid dreams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream).  These dreams come from a scientifically-minded individual--unwittingly cast into the role of amateur interviewer and experimenter.

To learn more, please visit [realityhandbook.org](http://realityhandbook.org/).  *(Or if there are technical problems, consult the [Internet Archive for realityhandbook.org](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://realityhandbook.org))*

The author's belief is that documenting dreams...especially very atypical ones...may constitue a "data set" which would be useful to analyze.  For others interested in how technology is being applied to this, they may also be interested in the [Shadow Project](http://discovershadow.com/).  They had a successful $82,577 KickStarter to develop mobile apps to assist in dream documention.


## FRAMEWORK

The website is built using a custom [Rebol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebol)-based web framework called [DRAEM](https://github.com/hostilefork/draem), designed for the purpose.  It supports the easy entry of dialogue, exposition, notes, and pictures.  See the Draem project documentation for that information.
